be	3

Since	1
the	4

we	2
will	2
merely	1
discuss	0
it	3

First	1

we	2
realize	1
that	3
a	3
pure	1
specialist	0
does	2
not	3
exist	1
.	4

But	2
,	4
for	3
practical	1
purposes	1

we	2
have	2
people	2
who	2
can	2
be	3
considered	1
as	3
such	2
.	4

For	2
example	1
,	4
there	2
are	3
persons	1
who	2
are	3
in	3
physical	1
science	1
,	4
in	3
the	4
field	1
of	3
mineralogy	0
,	4
trained	1
in	3

,	4
who	2
use	2
only	2

the	4

only	2
,	4
and	3
who	2
have	2

the	4

it	3

I	3
would	2
offer	1
other	2
evidence	1

I	3
will	2
mention	1
two	2
volumes	0
of	3
specific	1
comment	0
on	3
this	2
malaise	0
that	3
appeared	1
last	2
year	2

The	3
earlier	1
of	3
them	2
was	3
an	2
unofficial	0
enterprise	0

sponsored	0
by	3

under	2
the	4
title	1
of	3
the	4

The	3
contributors	0
to	3
this	2
testament	0
were	2
all	2
well-known	0

What	2
I	3
want	1
to	3
point	1
out	2

is	3
that	3
all	2

are	3
ex	0
liberals	0
,	4
or	3
modified	0

with	3
perhaps	1
one	2
exception	1

I	3
suppose	1
we	2
might	2
classify	0
Billy	0
Graham	0
as	3
an	2
old	2
liberal	1

And	2
I	3
would	2
further	1
note	1
that	3
they	2
all	2
-	3
with	3
one	2
exception	1
again	2
-	3
sang	0
in	3
one	2
key	1
or	3
another	2
the	4
same	2
song	1
.	4

Its	1
refrain	0
was	3
:	2
``	3
Let	1
us	2
return	1
to	3
the	4
individualistic	0
democracy	0
of	3
our	2
forefathers	0
for	3
our	2
salvation	0
''	3
.	4

Adlai	0

expressed	1
some	2
reservations	0
about	2
this	2
return	1

Others	0
invoked	0
technology	0
and	3

Only	1
Walter	0

envisioned	0
the	4
possibility	1
of	3
our	2
having	1
``	3
outlived	0
most	2

what	2
we	2
used	2
to	3
regard	1
as	3
the	4
program	1

our	2
national	1
purposes	1
''	3
.	4

But	2
the	4
most	2
notable	0
thing	1
about	2
the	4
incantation	0
of	3
these	2
ex	0
liberals	0
was	3
that	3
the	4
one-time	0
shibboleth	0
of	3
socialism	0
was	3
conspicuously	0
absent	1
.	4

The	3
second	1
specific	1
comment	0
was	3
the	4
report	1
of	3
Eisenhower	0
's	3
Commission	0
on	3
National	1
Goals	0
,	4
titled	0
Goals	0
For	2
Americans	1
.	4

They	2
,	4
perhaps	1
,	4
gave	1
the	4
pitch	0
of	3
their	2
position	1
in	3
the	4
preface	0
where	2
it	3
was	3
said	2
that	3
Eisenhower	0
requested	0
that	3
the	4
Commission	0
be	3
administered	0
by	3
the	4
American	2
Assembly	0
of	3
Columbia	0
University	1
,	4
because	2
it	3
was	3
non-partisan	0
.	4

The	3
Commission	0
seems	1
to	3
represent	0
the	4
viewpoint	0
of	3
what	2
I	3
would	2
call	1
the	4
unconscious	0
liberal	1
,	4
but	2
not	3
unconscious	0
enough	2
,	4
to	3
invoke	0
the	4
now	2
taboo	0
symbolism	0
of	3
socialism	0
.	4

And	2
here	2
again	2
we	2
hear	1
the	4
same	2
refrain	0
mentioned	1
above	1
:	2
``	3
The	3
paramount	0
goal	1

it	3
is	3
the	4
need	1
to	3
undertake	0
these	2
testaments	0
that	3

would	2
submit	0
here	2
as	3

And	2
let	1
me	2
add	1

it	3

so	2

though	2
I	3
may	2
add	1

with	3
considerably	1

I	3
will	2
reserve	0

symptomatic	0
of	3

you	2

to	3
say	2
confused	1

What	2
is	3
the	4
common	1
man	2
's	3
complaint	0
?	2

Let	1
's	3
take	2
a	3
panoramic	0
look	1
back	2
over	2
the	4
course	2
we	2
have	2
come	2

Has	0
not	3
that	3
way	2
been	2
lit	0
always	2
by	3
the	4
lamp	0
of	3
liberalism	0
up	2
until	2
the	4
turning	1
back	2
under	2
Eisenhower	0
?	2

And	2
the	4
basic	1
character	1
of	3
that	3
liberalism	0
has	2
been	2
spiritual	0
rather	1
than	2
economic	1
.	4

Ralph	0
Gabriel	0
gave	1
it	3
the	4
name	1
of	3
Protestant	1
philosophy	0
of	3
Progress	0
.	4

But	2
there	2
's	3
a	3
subjective	0
side	1
to	3
that	3
utopian	0
outlook	0
.	4

Does	1
our	2
society	1
have	2
a	3
runaway	0
,	4
uncontrollable	0
growth	1
of	3
technology	0
which	2
may	2
end	2
our	2
civilization	1
,	4
or	3
a	3
normal	1
,	4
healthy	1
growth	1
?	2

Here	1
there	2
may	2
be	3
an	2
analogy	0
with	3
cancer	1
:	2
we	2
can	2
detect	0
cancers	0
by	3
their	2
rapidly	1
accelerating	0
growth	1
,	4
determinable	0
only	2
when	2
related	1
to	3
the	4
more	2
normal	1
rate	1
of	3
healthy	1
growth	1
.	4

Should	0
the	4
accelerating	0
growth	1
of	3
technology	0
then	2
warn	0
us	2
?	2

Noting	0
such	2
evidence	1
is	3
the	4
first	2
step	1
;	2
and	3
almost	2
the	4
only	2
``	3
cure	1
''	3
is	3
early	1
detection	0
and	3
removal	0
.	4

One	2
way	2
to	3
determine	1
whether	1
we	2
have	2
so	2
dangerous	1
a	3
technology	0
would	2
be	3
to	3
check	1
the	4
strength	1
of	3
our	2
society	1
's	3
organs	0
to	3
see	2
if	2
their	2
functioning	0
is	3
as	3
healthy	1
as	3
before	2
.	4

So	1
an	2
objective	1
look	1
at	3
our	2
present	1
procedures	1
may	2
move	1
us	2
to	3
consider	1
seriously	1
this	2
possibly	1
analogous	0
situation	1
.	4

In	2
any	2
event	1
,	4
whether	1
society	1
may	2
have	2
cancer	1
,	4
or	3
merely	1
a	3
virus	0

the	4
``	3
disease	1

find	2

political	1
,	4
economical	0

social	1
,	4
and	3
even	2
medical	1

Have	1
not	3
our	2
physical	1
abilities	0
already	1
deteriorated	0
because	2
of	3
the	4
more	2
sedentary	0
lives	1
we	2
are	3
now	2
living	1
?	2

Hence	0
the	4
prime	0
issue	1
,	4
as	3
I	3
see	2
it	3
,	4
is	3
whether	1
a	3
democratic	0
or	3
free	1
society	1
can	2
master	1
technology	0
for	3
the	4
benefit	1
of	3
mankind	0
,	4
or	3
whether	1
technology	0
will	2
rule	0
and	3
develop	1
its	2
own	2
society	1
compatible	0
with	3
its	2
own	2
needs	1
as	3
a	3
force	1
of	3
nature	1

We	2
are	3
already	1
committed	0
to	3
establishing	0
man	2
's	3
supremacy	0
over	2
nature	1
and	3
everywhere	1
on	3
earth	1
,	4
not	3
merely	1
in	3
the	4
limited	1
social	1
political	1
economical	0
context	0
we	2
are	3
fond	0
of	3
today	1
.	4

Otherwise	0
,	4
we	2
go	2
on	3
endlessly	0
trying	1
to	3
draw	1
the	4
line	1
,	4
color	1
and	3
other	2
,	4
as	3
to	3
which	2
kind	1
of	3
man	2
we	2
wish	1
to	3
see	2
dominate	0

We	2
have	2
proved	1
so	2
able	1
to	3
solve	0
technological	0
problems	1
that	3
to	3
contend	0
we	2
cannot	1
realize	1
a	3
universal	1
goal	1
in	3
the	4
immediate	1
future	1
is	3
to	3
be	3
extremely	1
shortsighted	0

if	2
nothing	1

So	1
in	3
these	2
pages	0
the	4
term	1
``	3
technology	0
''	3
is	3
used	2
to	3
include	1
any	2

all	2

which	2
could	2
amplify	0

project	1

or	3
augment	0
man	2
's	3
control	1
over	2
himself	2
and	3
over	2

of	3
all	2
the	4
cultures	0
in	3
existence	1
today	1
throughout	1
the	4
world	2
,	4
we	2
must	2
employ	0
these	2
resources	1
without	2
war	1

If	2
we	2
were	2
creating	0
a	3

we	2
could	2
insist	0
that	3

But	2
we	2
cannot	1
start	1
off	2
with	3
a	3
clean	1

So	1
we	2
must	2
first	2
analyze	0

respect	1

us	2
survey	0

note	1
