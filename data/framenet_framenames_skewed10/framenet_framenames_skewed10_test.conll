great	1

that	2

in	3

and	3

to	3

After	1
we	1
took	1
a	3
look	0
at	2
the	3
situation	0
,	3
we	1
found	1
that	2
the	3
best	1
solutions	0
to	3
stop	0
thousands	1
of	3
people	1
from	2
renouncing	0
their	2
religion	0
,	3
is	2
to	3
cut	0
the	3
heads	0
of	3
the	3
Sheiks	0
of	3
infidelity	0
and	3
erratic	0
.	3

Before	0
we	1
start	0
reviewing	0
the	3
events	0
that	2
accured	0
here	1
,	3
we	1
ask	0
two	1
questions:	0

First	0
:	2
If	1
there	1
were	2
people	1
who	1
are	2
raping	0
thousands	1
of	3
Muslim	0
women	0
taking	0
their	2
honor	0
,	3
and	3
stealing	0
muslim	0
money	0
and	3
land	1
,	3
and	3
other	1
people	1
who	1
do	1
n't	1
rape	0
or	2
steal	0
,	3
but	2
they	1
take	1
the	3
religion	0
away	1
from	2
thousands	1
of	3
Muslims	0
,	3
what	1
's	2
more	1
important	1
,	3
religion	0
,	3
or	2
honor	0
and	3
land	1
?	2

What	1
we	1
learned	0
from	2
Muslim	0
scholars	0
is	2
that	2
robbing	0
the	3
religion	0
from	2
Muslims	0
,	3
is	2
greater	1
than	1
robbing	0
their	2
honor	0
and	3
land	1
.	3

God	0
said	1
``	2
turmoil	0
is	2
greater	1
than	1
murder	0
''	2
,	3
and	3
for	2
those	1
devils	0
,	3
their	2
danger	0
is	2
greater	1
than	1
who	1
rapes	0
,	3
or	2
rob	0
and	3
steal	0
money	0
or	2
land	1
.	3

Second	0
question	0
:	2
Why	0
did	1
we	1
announce	0
and	3
started	0
fighting	0
the	3
Shiites	0
and	3
police	0
from	2
the	3
start	0
,	3
even	1
though	1
most	1
of	3
the	3
Jihadist	0
sectors	0
and	3
the	3
public	1
did	1
n't	1
understand	0
what	1
we	1
want	1
,	3
and	3
did	1
n't	1
know	1
the	3
importance	0
of	3
starting	0
with	2
those	1
?	2

So	0
what	1
's	2
the	3
objection	0
on	2
killing	0
and	3
executing	0
the	3
Sheiks	0
now	1
and	3
without	1
a	3
notice	0
,	3
with	2
continiuing	0
making	1
people	1
understand	0
it	2
,	3
just	1
like	1
we	1
did	1
by	2
killing	0
the	3
police	0
then	1
?	2

Were	0
people	1
satisfied	0
with	2
us	1
?	2

Actually	0
lot	0
of	3
the	3
public	1
thinks	0
that	2
who	1
killed	0
the	3
police	0
is	2
Badr	0
organization	1
or	2
gangs	0
from	2
Iran	2
!	1

And	1
that	2
who	1
's	2
killing	0
Shiites	0
is	2
hired	0
by	2
Israel	1
and	3
the	3
U.S.	1
to	3
start	0
an	2
ethnic	0
war	1
and	3
so	1
on	2
.	3

From	1
what	1
we	1
saw	0
,	3
the	3
damage	0
caused	0
by	2
those	1
erratic	0
infidels	0
(	2
Tribes	0
Sheiks	0
,	3
The	2
Islamic	1
Party	0
)	2
is	2
more	1
dangerous	0
than	1
the	3
Shiites	0
and	3
the	3
peaceful	0
police	0
as	2
people	1
call	0
them	1
.	3

You	0
Sheik	0
announced	0
war	1
on	2
those	1
,	3
with	2
the	3
opposings	0
of	3
many	1
sectors	0
and	3
scholars	0
of	3
decision	0
making	1
.	3

The	2
brothers	0
now	1
are	2
wiping	0
out	1
the	3
heads	0
of	3
infidelity	0
,	3
as	2
soon	0
as	2
they	1
started	0
,	3
and	3
never	0
claiming	0
responsibility	0
,	3
we	1
found	1
among	1
us	1
who	1
wants	0
to	3
make	1
fuss	0
about	1
it	2
,	3
and	3
regretfully	0
some	1
of	3
the	3
brothers	0
with	2
us	1
in	3
the	3
organization	1
(	2
al-Qa'ida	0
)	2
see	1
it	2
as	2
nonsense	0
,	3
and	3
God	0
is	2
my	1
witness	0
.	3

My	0
Sheik	0
,	3
here	1
's	2
some	1
of	3
the	3
events	0
that	2
happened	0
in	3
Ramadi	0
:	2

1-	1
Sheik	0
Nasr	0
al-Fahdawi	0
,	3
Sheik	0
of	3
AlbuFahd	0
tribe	0
,	3
was	2
nominated	0
to	3
be	2
the	3
governor	0
of	3
Anbar	0
,	3
this	2
man	0
worked	0
so	1
hard	1
fighting	0
the	3
(	2
Tanzim	0
)	2
organization	1
,	3
with	2
all	1
he	1
's	2
got	1
,	3
from	2
money	0
to	3
power	1
,	3
and	3
reputation	0
in	3
Ramadi	0
.	3

So	0
we	1
tried	0
this	2
with	2
him	1
:	2
First	0
,	3
we	1
backed	0
off	1
during	1
the	3
elections	0
.	3

They	1
had	2
checkpoints	0
.	3

Utens	0
of	3
his	1
tribesmen	0
who	1
started	0
checking	0
cars	0
,	3
they	1
violated	0
our	1
brothers	0
many	1
times	1
.	3

They	1
even	1
announced	0
it	2
,	3
then	1
our	1
brothers	0
attacked	0
the	3
field	0
leader	0
,	3
the	3
brain	0
behind	0
people	1
revolting	0
at	2
al-Anbar	0
in	3
AlbuFahd	0
.	3

So	0
the	3
brothers	0
raided	0
his	1
house	1
in	3
the	3
middle	0
of	3
the	3
night	0
wearing	0
the	3

and	3
driving	0
similar	0
cars	0
.	3

They	1
took	1
him	1
and	3
killed	0
him	1
.	3

Thank	0
God	0
.	3

The	2
next	1
morning	0
his	1
households	0
and	3
neighbors	0
started	0
talking	0
to	3
the	3
tribe	0
saying	0
it	2

they	1
added	0
that	2
they	1

meaning	0
that	2

No	0

He	1

He	1

Yeah	0
.	3

Uh	0
but	2
as	2
far	1
as	2
the	3
sentencing	0
by	2
the	3
judge	0
,	3
i	0
would	1
have	2
to	3
vote	0
against	1
that	2
since	1
there	1
's	2
a	3
jury	0
because	1
that	2
's	2
what	1
the	3

are	2
for	2
is	2
to	3
make	1
the	3

Um	0
,	3
what	1
are	2
your	1
feelings	0
?	2

Yeah	0
.	3

Yeah	0

Well	0
if	1
I	1
-	2
I	1
saw	0
on	2
one	1
of	3
the	3
talk	0

this	2
woman	0
judge	0
i	0
believe	1
from	2
Florida	0
and	3
she	0
just	1
has	2
just	1
really	0
stiff	0
penalties	0
and	3
i	0
saw	0
that	2
in	3
in	3
the	3
hands	0
of	3
a	3
judge	0
that	2
really	0
was	2
conscientious	0
and	3
really	0
,	3
you	1
know	1
,	3
took	1
the	3
pains	0
to	3
give	0
a	3
sentence	0
for	2
what	1
was	2
deserved	0
,	3
it	2
could	1
-	2
you	1
could	1
have	2
a	3
-	2
a	3
judge	0
that	2
would	1
really	0
make	1
a	3
good	1
impact	0
,	3
but	2
likewise	0
you	1
could	1
have	2
the	3
flip	0
side	0
and	3
have	2
some	1
judge	0
that	2
was	2
paid	0
off	1
or	2
you	1
know	1
had	2
good	1
-	2
a	3
good	1
old	0
boy	0
network	0
,	3
or	2
,	3
for	2
whatever	0
reasons	1
,	3
you	1
know	1
,	3
politics	0
,	3
just	1
let	0
all	1
kinds	0
of	3
people	1
through	1
so	1
he	1

he	1
would	1
have	2
a	3
heck	0

she	0
would	1
have	2
a	3
heck	0
of	3
a	3
lot	0
of	3
power	1
,	3
you	1
know	1
,	3
if	1
used	1
wrongly	0
.	3

So	0
,	3
at	2
least	1
the	3
jury	0
system	1
does	1
something	0
to	3
prevent	0
that	2
,	3
you	1
know	1
,	3
or	2
help	1
it	2
-	2
with	2
it	2
-	2
anyway	0
.	3

I	1
do	1
n't	1
know	1
if	1
it	2
prevents	0
it	2
but	2
seems	0
like	1
the	3
jury	0
system	1
does	1
have	2
it	2
's	2
advantages	0
,	3
but	2
i	0
also	2
-	2
i	0
've	0
also	2
heard	0
on	2
trials	0
that	2
sometimes	0
they	1
go	1
through	1
,	3
like	1
,	3
three	1
hundred	0
jurors	0
before	1
they	1
hand	0

these	1

the	3
ones	0
that	2
are	2
going	0
to	3
be	2
the	3
most	1
lenient	0
you	1
know	1
.	3

And	1
i	0
do	1
n't	1
know	1
how	1
much	1
they	1
're	0
getting	0
just	1
a	3
jury	0
of	3
their	2

at	2
that	2
point	0

They	1
're	0
really	0

It	1
's	2
not	2
just	1
random	0
people	1

Hm	0

It	1
almost	1
should	1
be	2
the	3

One	1
of	3
Sherlock	0
Holmes	0
's	2
defects	0
--	2
if	1
,	3
indeed	0
,	3
one	1
may	1
call	0
it	2
a	3
defect	0
--	2
was	2
that	2
he	1
was	2
exceedingly	0
loath	0
to	3
communicate	0
his	1
full	1
plans	1
to	3
any	1
other	1
person	0
until	1
the	3
instant	0
of	3
their	2
fulfilment	0
.	3

Partly	0
it	2
came	1
no	1
doubt	0
from	2
his	1
own	1
masterful	0
nature	1
,	3
which	2
loved	0
to	3
dominate	0
and	3
surprise	0
those	1
who	1
were	2
around	1
him	1
.	3

Partly	0
also	2
from	2
his	1
professional	0
caution	0
,	3
which	2
urged	0
him	1
never	0
to	3
take	1
any	1
chances	0
.	3

The	2
result	1
,	3
however	1
,	3
was	2
very	1
trying	1
for	2
those	1
who	1
were	2
acting	0
as	2
his	1
agents	2
and	3
assistants	0
.	3

I	1
had	2
often	1
suffered	0
under	1
it	2
,	3
but	2
never	0
more	1
so	1
than	1
during	1
that	2
long	1
drive	0
in	3
the	3
darkness	0
.	3

The	2
great	1
ordeal	0
was	2
in	3
front	1
of	3
us	1
;	1
at	2
last	1
we	1
were	2
about	1
to	3
make	1
our	1
final	0
effort	1
,	3
and	3
yet	1
Holmes	0
had	2
said	1
nothing	0
,	3
and	3
I	1
could	1
only	1
surmise	0
what	1
his	1
course	0
of	3
action	0
would	1
be	2
.	3

My	0
nerves	0
thrilled	0
with	2
anticipation	0
when	1
at	2
last	1
the	3
cold	0
wind	0
upon	1
our	1
faces	0
and	3
the	3
dark	0
,	3
void	0
spaces	0
on	2
either	0
side	0
of	3
the	3
narrow	0
road	0
told	0
me	0
that	2
we	1
were	2
back	1
upon	1
the	3
moor	0
once	1
again	0
.	3

Every	0
stride	0
of	3
the	3
horses	0
and	3
every	1
turn	0
of	3
the	3
wheels	0
was	2
taking	0
us	1
nearer	0
to	3
our	1
supreme	0
adventure	0
.	3

Our	0
conversation	0
was	2
hampered	0
by	2
the	3
presence	0
of	3
the	3
driver	0
of	3
the	3
hired	0
wagonette	0
,	3
so	1
that	2
we	1
were	2
forced	0
to	3
talk	0
of	3
trivial	0
matters	0
when	1
our	1
nerves	0
were	2
tense	0
with	2
emotion	0
and	3
anticipation	0
.	3

It	1
was	2
a	3
relief	0
to	3
me	0
,	3
after	1
that	2
unnatural	0
restraint	0
,	3
when	1
we	1
at	2
last	1
passed	0
Frankland	0
's	2
house	1
and	3
knew	0
that	2
we	1
were	2
drawing	0
near	1
to	3
the	3

With	1

the	3

that	2

In	2

up	1
