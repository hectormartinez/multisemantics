You	0
and	3
I	1
have	2
done	0
some	1
important	1
work	1
together	0
.	3

We	1
've	0
helped	0
people	1
break	0
free	1
of	3
the	3
welfare	0
cycle	1

We	1
've	0
found	1
ways	0
for	2

to	3
enter	0
the	3
workforce	0
.	3

We	1
've	0
expanded	0
Goodwill	1
's	2
proven	0
methods	0
to	3
towns	0
and	3
neighborhoods	0
where	1
they	1
are	2
needed	1
most	1
.	3

Of	0
course	0
,	3
we	1
've	0
played	0
different	0
roles	0
.	3

You	0
have	2
helped	0
make	1
Goodwill	1
's	2
work	1
possible	1
with	2
your	1
previous	0

When	1
you	1
and	3
I	1
help	1
somebody	0
find	1
a	3
job	1
,	3
one	1
more	1
person	0
joins	0
the	3
ranks	0
of	3
tax	0

fewer	0
tax	0
dollars	0

spent	0
on	2
public	1

and	3

another	1

There	1
are	2
a	3

that	2
keep	0
people	1
from	2

physical	0

Dear	0
Joe	0
,	3

I	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
mean	0
about	1
being	1
a	3
journalist	0
.	3

Almost	0
every	1
assignment	0
is	2
a	3
challenge	0
in	3
a	3
different	0
way	1
and	3
it	2
never	0
seems	0
to	3
get	1
easier	0
.	3

I	1
often	1
feel	0
as	2
if	1
I	1
only	1
get	1
half	0
the	3
story	0
sometimes	0
,	3
so	1
I	1
typically	0
do	1
a	3
massive	0
amount	0
of	3
reporting	0
that	2
is	2
most	1
often	1
much	1
more	1
than	1
I	1
will	2
ever	0
need	1
.	3

I	1
think	0
that	2
is	2
why	0
I	1
welcomed	0
doing	0
a	3
book	0
--	2
it	2
gives	0
one	1
the	3
ability	1
to	3
use	1
so	1
much	1
of	3
what	1
is	2
left	1
on	2
the	3
cutting	0
room	0
floor	0
of	3
daily	0
journalism	0
.	3

Think	0
of	3
all	1
the	3
good	1
stuff	0
we	1
all	1
collect	0
daily	0
in	3
our	1
reporting	0
that	2
we	1
never	0
add	0
to	3
stories	0
.	3

Most	0
often	1
reporters	0
recount	0
these	1
tales	0
with	2
each	0
other	1
and	3
with	2
their	2
sources	1
rather	1
than	1
share	0
them	1
with	2
the	3
general	0
public	1
.	3

Much	0
of	3
it	2
,	3
of	3
course	0
,	3
using	1
the	3
standards	0
of	3
top	0
newspapers	0
,	3
can	1
not	2
be	2
used	1
since	1
it	2
is	2
largely	0
gossip	0
we	1
are	2
repeating	0
,	3
although	1
it	2
certainly	0
could	1
make	1
for	2
some	1
very	1
good	1
stories	0
.	3

I	1
often	1
wonder	0
when	1
a	3
really	0
great	1
fictional	0
book	0
will	2
be	2
written	0
about	1
this	2
era	0
(	2
probably	1
decades	0
and	3
decades	0
hence	0
as	2
it	2
is	2
too	0
close	1
)	2
.	3

In	2
any	1
case	1
,	3
there	1
certainly	0
is	2
no	1
lack	0
of	3
information	1
available	1
about	1
the	3
moguls	0
of	3
technology	1
now	1
as	2
they	1
all	1
become	1
our	1
current	0
pop	0
icons	0
.	3

I	1
would	1
posit	0
that	2
Bill	0
and	3
Michael	0
and	3
Steve	0
and	3
Jerry	0
have	2
become	1
the	3
Madonnas	0
of	3
the	3
current	0
age	0
of	3
stock	0
market	0
mania	0
and	3
celebration	0
of	3
the	3
entrepreneur	0
.	3

So	0
the	3
shift	0
in	3
the	3
image	0
of	3
Gates	0
has	2
been	2
an	2
interesting	0
one	1
for	2
me	0
to	3
watch	0
.	3

The	2
smart-boy	0
technologist	0
is	2
now	1
being	1
painted	0
as	2
the	3
whiny	0
bully	0
.	3

I	1
personally	0
always	1
thought	0
it	2
was	2
a	3
risk	0
to	3
pin	0
the	3
image	0
of	3
Microsoft	0
on	2
just	1
one	1
man	0
--	2
at	2
AOL	0
,	3
for	2
example	1
,	3
there	1
was	2
a	3
conscious	0
effort	1
to	3
develop	1
other	1
``	2
characters	0
,	3
''	2
for	2
lack	0
of	3
a	3
better	1
word	0
.	3

So	0
there	1
,	3
while	1
you	1
think	0
of	3
Case	0
,	3
you	1
also	2
think	0
of	3
Pittman	0
and	3
Leonsis	0
and	3
increasingly	0
a	3
range	1
of	3
other	1
executives	0
.	3

Steve	0
Ballmer	0
,	3
of	3
course	0
,	3
is	2
now	1
getting	0
a	3
lot	0
more	1
attention	0
at	2
Microsoft	0
,	3
but	2
it	2
still	1
seems	0
to	3
be	2
Bill	0
's	2
show	0
over	1
there	1
.	3

While	1
I	1
did	1
not	2
attend	0
the	3
trial	0
--	2
I	1
was	2
lucky	0
to	3
be	2
able	1
to	3
read	0
your	1
highly	1
amusing	0
and	3
informative	0
dispatches	0
,	3
several	1
of	3
which	2
made	1
me	0
spit	0
up	1
my	1
lunch	0
laughing	0
--	2
it	2
certainly	0
seemed	0
as	2
if	1
the	3
image	0
of	3
Bill	0
Gates	0
took	1
a	3
beating	0
and	3
the	3
insular	0
culture	0
of	3
Microsoft	0
did	1
not	2
look	0
so	1
good	1
.	3

That	1
's	2
ironic	0
,	3
since	1
I	1
think	0
it	2
was	2
just	1
that	2
insularity	0
that	2
helped	0
them	1
,	3
much	1
in	3
the	3
same	1
way	1
that	2
AOL	0
has	2
benefited	0
from	2
being	1
in	3
the	3
Virginia	0
suburbs	0
rather	1
than	1
in	3
Silicon	0
Valley	0
.	3

AOL	0
would	1
never	0
have	2
existed	0
if	1
it	2
had	2
been	2
founded	0
here	1
,	3
I	1
am	0
sure	0
,	3
since	1
its	2
employees	0
would	1
have	2
been	2
mocked	0
into	1
obscurity	0
by	2
the	3
digerati	0
.	3

Out	0
in	3
the	3
D.C.	0
area	1
,	3
they	1
looked	0
positively	0
exciting	0
next	1
to	3
all	1
the	3
government-oriented	0
contractors	0
.	3

I	1
wonder	0
if	1
that	2
means	0
geography	0
is	2
destiny	0
,	3
and	3
it	2
's	2
still	1
location	1
,	3
location	1
,	3
location	1
.	3

From	1
where	1
I	1
am	0
sitting	0
,	3
I	1
think	0
the	3
Microsoft	0
trial	0
has	2
been	2
the	3
really	0
obvious	0
turning	0
point	0
between	1
the	3
computer	0
era	0
and	3
the	3
digital	0
age	0
.	3

I	1
think	0
it	2
almost	1
does	1
not	2
matter	0
what	1
the	3
judge	0
does	1
since	1
it	2
's	2
clear	0
that	2
the	3
balance	0
of	3
power	1
is	2
shifting	0
again	0
,	3
although	1
it	2
not	2
clear	0
where	1
it	2
will	2
land	1
.	3

Will	0
the	3
strongman	0
of	3
the	3
era	0
be	2
AOL	0
,	3
AT	0
and	3
T	0
,	3
Microsoft	0
,	3
or	2
one	1
of	3
the	3
big	0
media	0
companies	1
?	2

Or	0
will	2
it	2
be	2
none	0
of	3
them	1
because	1
the	3
Internet	0
allows	0
and	3
encourages	0
a	3
plethora	0
of	3
strong	1
companies	1
and	3
a	3
complex	1
interconnection	0
of	3
businesses	0
where	1
none	0
are	2
allowed	0
to	3
dominate	0
?	2

I	1
always	1
use	1
two	1
simple	0
words	0
when	1
people	1
tell	0
me	0
that	2
one	1
company	1
--	2
whether	1
it	2
is	2
AOL	0
or	2
Microsoft	0
or	2
Disney	0
--	2
is	2
in	3
charge	0
of	3
all	1
our	1
destinies	0
:	2
Babylon	0
was	2
.	3

That	1
incredible	0
empire	0
dominated	0
the	3
world	1
and	3
I	1
imagine	0
it	2
did	1
not	2
seem	0
possible	1
to	3
people	1

then	1
that	2
anyone	0
could	1
loosen	0
that	2
empire	0

on	2

But	1
we	1
all	1
know	1
how	1
that	2
story	0
turned	0
out	1

Now	0
I	1
am	0
getting	0
way	1
too	0

but	2
this	2
is	2
my	1
final	0
missive	0

so	1
why	0

Perhaps	0
you	1
could	1
hasten	0
a	3

where	1
this	2
