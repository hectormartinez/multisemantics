demarcated	B-Mental

such	O

went	B-BoundedEvent
on	I-BoundedEvent

any	O

asked	B-Mental
,	O
eagerly	O
,	O
``	O
Did	O
you	O
see	B-Mental

?	O

At	O
first	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
know	B-Mental
what	O
she	O
meant	B-Mental
;	O
I	O
thought	B-Mental
she	O
must	O
be	O
seeing	B-Mental
me	O
as	O
some	O
one	O
who	O
had	O
just	O
come	B-BoundedEvent
from	O
seeing	B-Agentive
her	O
grandmother	B-Animate
,	O
in	O
their	O
distant	O
home	O

Then	O
I	O
realized	B-Mental
that	O
she	O
had	O
been	O
deliberately	O
showing	B-Mental
me	O
,	O
this	O
time	B-BoundedEvent
,	O
what	O
Granny	B-Animate
was	B-UnboundedEvent

I	O
replied	B-Mental

At	O
another	O
phase	B-Mental
in	O
the	O
therapy	B-Agentive
,	O
when	O
a	O
pathogenic	O
mother	B-Animate
introject	B-Mental
began	B-BoundedEvent
to	O
emerge	B-BoundedEvent
more	O
and	O
more	O
upon	O
the	O
investigative	O
scene	B-UnboundedEvent
,	O
she	O
muttered	B-Mental
in	O
a	O
low	O
but	O
intense	O
voice	B-Property
,	O
to	O
herself	O
,	O
``	O
I	O

I	O
could	O
evoke	B-Mental
no	O
further	O
elaboration	B-Agentive
from	O
her	O
about	O
this	O
;	O
but	O
a	O
few	O
seconds	B-Mental
later	O
she	O
was	O
standing	B-UnboundedEvent
directly	O
across	O
the	O
room	B-Object
from	O
me	O
,	O
looking	B-Mental
me	O
in	O
the	O
eyes	B-Object

saying	B-Mental
in	O
a	O
scathingly	O
condemnatory	O
tone	B-Mental
,	O
``	O
Your	O
father	B-Animate
despises	B-Mental

!	O

Again	O
,	O
I	O
at	O
first	O
misconstrued	B-Mental
this	O
disconcertingly	O
intense	O
communication	B-Mental
,	O
and	O
I	O
quickly	O
cast	B-Mental
through	O
my	O
mind	B-Mental
to	O
account	B-Mental
for	I-Mental
her	O
being	B-UnboundedEvent
able	O
to	O
speak	B-Mental
,	O
with	O
such	O
utter	O
conviction	B-Mental

opinion	B-Mental
held	B-Mental
by	O
my	O
father	B-Animate

now	O
several	O
years	B-Mental
deceased	O

Then	O
I	O
replied	B-Mental
,	O
coldly	O
,	O
``	O
If	O
you	O

why	O

you	O

She	O
looked	B-BoundedEvent
confused	O
at	O
this	O

I	O
felt	B-Mental

had	O
been	B-UnboundedEvent

wrong	O
response	B-Mental
for	O
me	O
to	O
make	B-Agentive

It	O
then	O
occurred	B-Mental
to	O
me	O
to	O
ask	B-Mental

``	O

She	O
clearly	O
agreed	B-Mental

this	O
had	O
been	B-UnboundedEvent

case	B-Mental

I	O
realized	B-Mental

that	O
she	O
had	O
been	O

in	O
what	O

very	O

something	O
her	O

once	O

her	O

it	O
was	B-UnboundedEvent

she	O
was	O

she	O

his	O

tried	B-Agentive

that	O
the	O

he	O

When	O

left	B-BoundedEvent

Stanley	B-Animate

could	O
always	O
predict	B-Mental
what	O
Stanley	B-Animate
was	O
going	O

ever	O
since	O
she	O
first	O
met	B-Agentive

Except	O
for	O
that	O
one	O
morning	B-Mental

The	O
morning	B-Mental

announce	B-Mental

her	O
,	O
blushing	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
was	B-UnboundedEvent

She	O
thought	B-Mental

was	O
going	O
to	O

She	O
had	O
assumed	B-Mental
before	O

that	O
one	O

would	O
ask	B-Mental
her	O
to	O
marry	B-Agentive

Blanche	B-Animate
could	O
n't	O
remember	B-Mental
when	O
she	O
had	O
first	O
arrived	B-BoundedEvent
at	O
this	O
conclusion	B-Mental

She	O
thought	B-Mental
it	O
was	O
sometime	O
during	O
the	O
second	O
week	B-Mental
she	O
worked	O
for	O
Stanley	B-Animate
.	O

It	O
was	O
nothing	B-Mental
that	O
he	O
said	B-Mental
or	O
did	B-Agentive
,	O
but	O
it	O
seemed	B-Mental
so	O
natural	O
to	O
her	O
that	O
she	O
should	O
be	O
working	O
for	O
him	O
,	O
looking	B-Mental
forward	I-Mental

his	O
eventual	O

She	O

thirty-one	O
years	B-Mental

Her	O

was	B-UnboundedEvent
already	O
considerably	O
concerned	O
over	O
her	O
daughter	B-Animate

future	B-Mental

But	O
Blanche	B-Animate
had	O
been	O
able	O
to	O
maintain	B-Agentive
a	O
serene	O
and	O
assured	O
composure	B-Property
in	O
the	O
face	B-Agentive
of	O
her	O
widowed	O
mother	B-Animate

continued	O
carping	B-Mental

had	O
been	B-UnboundedEvent

to	O
resist	B-UnboundedEvent

urgings	B-Mental

date	B-Agentive
anyone	O
who	O
offered	B-Mental
the	O
slightest	O
possibility	B-Mental
of	O
matrimony	B-UnboundedEvent

For	O
Blanche	B-Animate
,	O
it	O
was	O
only	O
a	O
matter	B-Mental
of	O
time	B-Mental
before	O
Stanley	B-Animate
would	O
propose	B-Mental

It	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
expected	O
that	O
Stanley	B-Animate
would	O
be	B-UnboundedEvent
shy	O
,	O
slow	O
in	O
taking	B-Agentive
such	O
a	O
momentous	O
step	B-Agentive

Stanley	B-Animate
went	B-UnboundedEvent
along	I-UnboundedEvent
in	O
life	B-Mental
,	O
she	O
knew	B-Mental
,	O
convinced	O
that	O
he	O
deserved	B-UnboundedEvent
the	O
love	B-Mental

faith	B-Mental
of	O
no	O

As	O
a	O
result	O

he	O
never	O
looked	B-UnboundedEvent

But	O
one	O
day	B-Mental
,	O
she	O
expected	B-Mental
,	O
he	O
would	O
somehow	O
discover	B-Mental
,	O
without	O
her	O
having	O
to	O
tell	B-Mental
him	O
,	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
such	O
a	O
woman	B-Animate
in	O
the	O
world	B-Object
;	O
a	O
woman	B-Animate
who	O
was	B-UnboundedEvent
willing	O
to	O
give	B-Mental
him	O
love	B-Mental

,	O
and	O
anything	O
else	O
a	O
woman	B-Animate
could	O
give	B-Mental
a	O

Indeed	O

there	O

a	O
woman	B-Animate
who	O

unasked	O

had	O
already	O
given	B-Mental

Unquestionably	O

Blanche	B-Animate
loved	B-Mental
Stanley	B-Animate

And	O
then	O
,	O
unexpectedly	O
,	O
Stanley	B-Animate
made	O
his	O
announcement	B-Mental

On	O
that	O
first	O
day	B-Mental
,	O
Blanche	B-Animate
literally	O

at	O
the	O

It	O
might	O

her	O
if	O

Kitti	B-Animate
could	O
have	O
married	B-Agentive

There	O
was	O

Stanley	B-Animate

Kitti	B-Animate

on	O
somebody	O

because	O
she	O

Stanley	B-Animate

because	O
,	O
when	O
he	O
was	B-UnboundedEvent
finished	O

it	O
was	O
close	O

the	O
lunch	B-Object

he	O

politely	O
asked	B-Mental
Kitti	B-Animate
to	O
join	B-Agentive

,	O
never	O
expecting	B-Mental
her	O
to	O
accept	B-Mental

Blanche	B-Animate
knew	B-Mental
all	O
this	O
because	O
the	O
door	B-Object

Stanley	B-Animate

,	O
without	O

hard	O

she	O
could	O
hear	B-Mental
everything	O
that	O

Stanley	B-Animate
had	O
gone	B-BoundedEvent

saying	B-Mental
he	O
would	O
be	B-UnboundedEvent

He	O
had	O
n't	O

There	O
were	O
mornings	B-Mental

It	O

Somehow	O

Blanche	B-Animate

The	O
wastebasket	B-Object

the	O
wall	B-Object

the	O
divan	B-Object
,	O
and	O
the	O
instant	B-Mental
Casey	B-Animate
picked	B-UnboundedEvent
it	O
up	O
he	O
knew	B-Mental
what	O
had	O
happened	B-BoundedEvent
.	O

The	O
discarded	O
papers	B-Mental
inside	O
were	B-UnboundedEvent
sodden	O
,	O
there	O
was	B-UnboundedEvent
a	O
glint	B-BoundedEvent
of	O
liquid	O
at	O
the	O
bottom	B-Object
,	O
and	O
the	O
smell	B-Mental
of	O
whisky	B-Object
was	B-UnboundedEvent
strong	O
and	O
distinct	O
.	O

He	O
put	B-UnboundedEvent
the	O
basket	B-Object
down	O
distastefully	O
,	O
muttering	B-Mental
softly	O
and	O
thoroughly	O
disgusted	O
with	O
himself	O
and	O
his	O
plan	B-Mental
that	O
had	O
seemed	B-Mental
so	O
foolproof	O
.	O

For	O
he	O
remembered	B-Mental
too	O
well	O
how	O
he	O
had	O
brought	B-BoundedEvent
back	O
the	O
loaded	O
drinks	B-Object
to	O
Burton	B-Animate
and	O
then	O
returned	B-BoundedEvent
to	O
the	O
kitchen	B-Object
to	O
get	B-Mental
weaker	O
drinks	B-Object
for	O
himself	O
.	O

For	O
another	O
second	B-Mental
or	O
two	O
he	O
gave	B-Mental
in	I-Mental
to	O
the	O
annoyance	B-Mental
that	O
was	O
directed	B-Agentive
at	O
himself	O
;	O
then	O
his	O
mind	B-Mental
moved	B-BoundedEvent
on	I-BoundedEvent
to	O
be	O
confronted	B-Mental
by	O
something	O
far	O
more	O
serious	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
the	O
thought	B-Mental
expanded	B-BoundedEvent
,	O
the	O
implications	B-Mental
jarred	B-UnboundedEvent
him	O
.	O

It	O
no	O
longer	O
mattered	B-UnboundedEvent
that	O
Burton	B-Animate
had	O
outsmarted	B-Agentive
him	O
.	O

The	O
important	O
thing	B-UnboundedEvent
was	B-UnboundedEvent
that	O
Burton	B-Animate
had	O
gone	B-BoundedEvent
somewhere	O
to	O
meet	B-Agentive
a	O
blackmailer	B-Animate
with	O
a	O
gun	B-Object
in	O
his	O
pocket	B-Object
.	O

And	O
that	O
gun	B-Object
was	B-UnboundedEvent
empty	O
.	O

Even	O
before	O
his	O
mind	B-Mental
had	O
rounded	B-BoundedEvent
out	I-BoundedEvent
the	O
idea	B-Mental
,	O
he	O
thrust	B-BoundedEvent
one	O
hand	B-Object
into	O
his	O
trousers	B-Object
pocket	B-Object
and	O
pulled	B-BoundedEvent
out	I-BoundedEvent
the	O
six	O
slugs	B-Object
he	O
had	O
taken	B-BoundedEvent
from	O
the	O
revolver	B-Object
.	O

He	O
considered	B-Mental
them	O
with	O
brooding	O
eyes	B-Object
,	O
brows	B-Object
bunched	B-UnboundedEvent
as	O
his	O
brain	B-Mental
grappled	B-Agentive
with	O
the	O
problem	B-UnboundedEvent
and	O
tried	B-Agentive
to	O
find	B-Mental
some	O
solution	B-Mental
.	O

He	O
said	B-Mental
:	O
``	O
The	O
crazy	O
fool	B-Animate
''	O
,	O
half	O
aloud	O
.	O

He	O
put	B-UnboundedEvent
the	O
shells	B-Object
on	O
the	O
table	B-Object
,	O
as	O
though	O
he	O
could	O
no	O
longer	O
bear	B-Mental
to	O
hold	B-UnboundedEvent
them	O
.	O

He	O
thought	B-Mental
:	O
Where	O
the	O
hell	O
could	O
he	O
have	O
gone	B-BoundedEvent
?	O

How	O
can	O
I	O
find	B-Mental
him	O
?	O

There	O
was	B-UnboundedEvent
no	O
answer	B-Mental
to	O
this	O
and	O
he	O
began	B-BoundedEvent
to	O
pace	B-BoundedEvent
back	O
and	O
forth	O
across	O
the	O
room	B-Object
,	O
his	O
imagination	B-Mental
out	O
of	O
control	B-Property
.	O

He	O
tried	B-Agentive
to	O
tell	B-Mental
himself	O
that	O
maybe	O
Burton	B-Animate
had	O
sobered	B-BoundedEvent
up	I-BoundedEvent
enough	O
to	O
get	B-Mental
some	O
sense	B-Mental
.	O

Maybe	O
he	O
only	O
intended	B-Mental
to	O
scare	B-Mental
the	O
blackmailer	B-Animate
,	O
whoever	O
he	O
was	B-UnboundedEvent
,	O
in	O
which	O
case	O
an	O
unloaded	O
gun	B-Object
would	O
be	B-UnboundedEvent
good	O
enough	O
.	O

He	O
thought	B-Mental
of	I-Mental
other	O
possibilities	B-Mental
,	O
none	O
of	O
them	O
satisfactory	O
,	O
and	O
finally	O
he	O
began	B-BoundedEvent
to	O
think	B-Mental
,	O
to	O
wonder	B-Mental
if	O
there	O
was	B-UnboundedEvent
some	O
way	B-Property
he	O
could	O
reach	B-Mental
Burton	B-Animate
.	O

Then	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
turned	B-BoundedEvent
toward	O
the	O
telephone	B-Object
,	O
it	O
rang	B-Mental
shrilly	O
to	O
shatter	B-BoundedEvent
the	O
stillness	B-Property
in	O
the	O
room	B-Object
and	O
he	O
reached	B-UnboundedEvent
for	O
it	O
eagerly	O

``	O

Casey	B-Animate

he	O
knew	B-Mental
who	O

he	O

what	O

He	O
kept	B-UnboundedEvent

watching	B-Mental
the	O

was	B-UnboundedEvent
because	O
he	O

n't	O

There	O
was	O

them	O

They	O

nobody	O

During	O
all	O

he	O
had	O
only	O
done	B-Agentive
things	B-Agentive

This	O
habit	B-Agentive
had	O
become	B-BoundedEvent
so	O
fixed	O
over	O
the	O
years	B-Mental
that	O
it	O
seemed	B-Mental
futile	O
to	O
do	B-Agentive
anything	O
for	O
which	O
no	O
one	O
was	O
waiting	B-Mental

He	O
looked	B-Mental

Mr.	B-Animate
Mills	I-Animate
had	O
done	B-Agentive
some	O
figuring	B-Mental

a	O
scrap	B-Object

the	O
cellar	B-Object

a	O

Mr.	B-Animate

anyone	O

someone	O

he	O
would	O
have	B-Mental
a	O

hang	B-UnboundedEvent

something	O

work	B-Agentive

that	O
everything	O

his	O
amazement	B-Mental

a	O

he	O
tossed	O
off	O
the	O

The	O
only	O
trouble	B-Mental

that	O
he	O
himself	O
was	B-UnboundedEvent
tied	O
up	O

Carpenters	B-Animate
all	O

at	O
the	O
moment	B-Mental
every	O
mother's	O

twenty	O

twenty-five	O

working	B-Agentive

There	O
was	O
a	O
fellow	B-Animate

Blatz	B-Animate
over	O
Smithtown	B-Object

Nobody	O
liked	B-Mental

never	O

Mr.	B-Animate

would	O
probably	O
see	B-BoundedEvent
him	O
at	O
Lodge	B-Object

If	O

Mr.	B-Animate

turned	B-UnboundedEvent

that	O

Mr.	B-Animate
Crombie	I-Animate

life	B-UnboundedEvent

he	O
moved	B-BoundedEvent

Highfield	B-Object

in	O

the	O
fact	B-Mental
that	O
he	O

work	B-Agentive
very	O
fast	O
or	O
very	O
long	O
at	O
a	O
time	O

and	O
he	O
did	O
n't	O
like	B-Mental
to	O
work	B-Agentive
at	O
all	O
unless	O
Mr.	B-Animate
Crombie	I-Animate
hung	B-UnboundedEvent
around	I-UnboundedEvent
and	O
talked	B-Mental
to	O
him	O

He	O
said	B-Mental
he	O
was	B-UnboundedEvent
the	O
lonely	O
type	B-Animate
and	O
working	B-Agentive
in	O
a	O
cellar	B-Object
you	O
saw	B-Mental
funny	O
things	B-Object
coming	B-BoundedEvent
out	O

the	O

in	O
the	O

if	O
they	O
was	B-UnboundedEvent
n't	O
nobody	O

you	O

So	O
Mr.	B-Animate
Crombie	I-Animate
sat	B-UnboundedEvent
on	O
a	O
wooden	O
box	B-Object

talked	B-Mental
in	O
order	O
to	O
keep	B-UnboundedEvent
Mr.	B-Animate
Blatz	I-Animate
's	O
mind	B-Mental
from	O
funny	O
things	B-Object

At	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
he	O
watched	B-Mental
carefully	O
to	O
see	B-Mental
how	O
one	O
attached	B-UnboundedEvent
pegboards	B-Object
to	O
stone	B-Object

but	O
Mr.	B-Animate
Blatz	I-Animate
was	O
usually	O
standing	B-UnboundedEvent
in	O
his	O
line	B-Object
of	I-Object
vision	I-Object
and	O
it	O
all	O
seemed	B-Mental
so	O
simple	O
that	O
he	O
did	O
n't	O
like	B-Mental
to	O
disclose	B-Mental
his	O
ignorance	B-Mental

While	O
Mr.	B-Animate
Blatz	I-Animate
was	O
putting	B-UnboundedEvent
up	I-UnboundedEvent
the	O
pegboards	B-Object
and	O
starting	B-BoundedEvent
the	O
workbench	B-Object
,	O
Mr.	B-Animate
Crombie	I-Animate
told	B-Mental
him	O
of	O
this	O
idea	B-Mental
about	O
paneling	B-Agentive
the	O
whole	O
end	B-Object
of	O
the	O

Mr.	B-Animate
Blatz	I-Animate
agreed	B-Mental
that	O
this	O
would	O
be	B-UnboundedEvent
pretty	O
.	O

Without	O
further	O
discussion	B-Mental
he	O
appeared	B-BoundedEvent
the	O
next	O
morning	B-Mental
with	O
a	O
pile	B-Object

boards	B-Object
sticking	O
over	O
the	O

his	O
light	O

proceeded	B-BoundedEvent
with	O
the	O
paneling	B-Object

which	O
he	O
then	O
stained	B-BoundedEvent

waxed	B-UnboundedEvent

his	O
taste	B-Mental

``	O
