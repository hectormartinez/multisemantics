In	O
arguing	B-Mental
in	O
this	O
way	B-Property

we	O
are	O
obviously	O
taking	B-Mental
for	O
granted	O
that	O
a	O
demythologized	O
restatement	B-Mental
of	O
the	O
kerygma	B-Mental
can	O
be	O
achieved	B-Agentive

and	O
that	O
we	O
firmly	O
believe	B-Mental
this	O
will	O
presently	O
become	B-BoundedEvent
evident	O
when	O
we	O
set	B-Mental
forth	I-Mental
reasons	B-Mental

justify	B-Mental
such	O
a	O
conviction	B-Mental

But	O
the	O
main	O
point	B-Mental
here	O
is	B-UnboundedEvent

such	O

the	O

to	O
demythologize	B-BoundedEvent
the	O
kerygma	B-Mental

still	O
be	B-UnboundedEvent

This	O
is	B-UnboundedEvent
what	O
we	O
mean	B-Mental

we	O

where	O
I	O

or	O
where	O
I	O
do	O
not	O
have	B-Mental
the	O
right	B-Property
to	O
say	B-Mental
anything	O
at	O
all	O
,	O
then	O
my	O
only	O
choice	B-Mental
is	B-UnboundedEvent
to	O
refuse	B-Mental

Christian	B-Animate

Expressed	B-Mental
differently	O
:	O
if	O
the	O
price	B-Property
for	O
becoming	B-BoundedEvent
a	O
faithful	O
follower	B-Animate

Jesus	B-Animate

is	B-UnboundedEvent
some	O
form	B-Mental

In	O
affirming	B-Mental
this	O
we	O

For	O
we	O

If	O
the	O
demand	B-Mental

demythologization	B-Mental

qualification	B-Agentive

the	O

our	O

To	O
do	B-Agentive
this	O

it	O

the	O

since	O

Physically	O

To	O
say	B-Mental
that	O

had	O
reduced	B-BoundedEvent

merely	O
reiterates	B-Mental
the	O

statement	B-Mental
that	O

eliminated	B-BoundedEvent
much	O
of	O

But	O
a	O

that	O
the	O

a	O

celebration	B-BoundedEvent
which	O
we	O
still	O
recognize	B-Mental

It	O
is	B-UnboundedEvent
curious	O
that	O
even	O
centuries	B-Mental
of	O
repetition	B-BoundedEvent
of	O
the	O
yearly	O
cycle	B-BoundedEvent
did	O
not	O
induce	B-Agentive
a	O
sufficient	O
degree	B-Property
of	O
confidence	B-Mental
to	O
allow	B-Agentive
people	B-Object
to	O
abandon	B-Mental
the	O
ceremonies	B-BoundedEvent

This	O
and	O
other	O
fears	B-Mental
of	O
the	O
solar	B-Object
system	I-Object
have	O
disappeared	B-BoundedEvent
gradually	O

first	O

with	O
the	O
Ptolemaic	B-Mental
system	I-Mental

its	O
built-in	O
concept	B-Mental

then	O
,	O
more	O

This	O
understanding	B-Mental
provides	B-Mental
a	O
very	O
simple	O
example	B-Mental
of	O
the	O
fact	B-Mental
that	O
one	O
can	O
eliminate	B-BoundedEvent
fear	B-Mental
without	O
instituting	B-Agentive
any	O
controls	B-UnboundedEvent

In	O
fact	O
,	O
although	O
we	O
have	O
dispelled	B-BoundedEvent
the	O
fear	B-Mental

we	O
have	O
not	O
necessarily	O
assured	B-Mental
ourselves	O
that	O
there	O
are	B-UnboundedEvent
no	O
dangers	B-UnboundedEvent

There	O
is	B-UnboundedEvent
still	O
the	O
remote	O
possibility	B-Mental

A	O

fall	B-BoundedEvent

could	O
presumably	O
bring	B-Agentive
long	O
periods	B-Mental

flood	B-BoundedEvent
or	O
drought	B-UnboundedEvent

Our	O
understanding	B-Mental
of	O
the	O
solar	B-Object
system	I-Object
has	O
taught	B-Mental
us	O
to	O
replace	B-BoundedEvent
our	O
former	O
elaborate	O
rituals	B-Agentive
with	O
the	O
appropriate	O
action	B-Agentive

,	O
in	O
this	O

amounts	B-UnboundedEvent
to	O
doing	B-Agentive
nothing	B-Mental

Yet	O
we	O
no	O

feel	B-Mental

there	O

We	O

And	O
yet	O
we	O
obviously	O
also	O
believe	B-Mental
that	O
the	O
avoidance	B-Agentive

since	O

When	O

that	O

we	O

Clearly	O

Indeed	O
we	O
should	O
say	B-Mental

on	O
the	O

that	O
the	O

the	O

It	O
ideally	O
removes	B-BoundedEvent

The	O

here	O
distort	B-Mental

I	O
can	O
see	B-Agentive

only	O
one	O
way	B-Object
out	I-Object

the	O

He	O
holds	B-Mental
that	O
goodness	B-Property

badness	B-Property
lie	B-UnboundedEvent
in	I-UnboundedEvent
feelings	B-Mental
of	O
approval	B-Mental

And	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
way	B-Agentive
in	O
which	O
he	O
might	O
hold	B-Mental
that	O
badness	B-Property
did	O
in	O
this	O
case	B-UnboundedEvent
precede	B-UnboundedEvent
our	O
own	O

to	I-UnboundedEvent
the	O
pain	B-UnboundedEvent

The	O
pain	B-UnboundedEvent
in	O
itself	O
was	B-UnboundedEvent
neutral	O

but	O
unfortunately	O
the	O
rabbit	B-Animate
,	O
on	O
no	O
grounds	B-Mental
at	O
all	O

took	B-Mental
up	I-Mental

this	O

an	O
attitude	B-Mental
of	O

that	O

in	O
the	O
only	O
intelligible	O
sense	B-Mental

This	O
way	B-Agentive
of	O
escape	B-Agentive
is	B-UnboundedEvent
theoretically	O
possible	O

since	O
it	O

been	B-UnboundedEvent
urged	B-Mental

it	O
is	B-UnboundedEvent
perhaps	O
best	O
not	O
to	O
spend	B-Mental
time	B-Mental
over	O
it	O

I	O
come	B-BoundedEvent

to	O
a	O

make	B-Agentive
our	O

about	O
its	O
suffering	B-UnboundedEvent
being	B-UnboundedEvent
a	O

thing	B-UnboundedEvent
,	O
we	O
presumably	O
make	B-Agentive
it	O
with	O
some	O
feeling	B-Mental
;	O
the	O
positivists	B-Animate
are	B-UnboundedEvent
plainly	O
right	O
in	O
saying	B-Mental
that	O
such	O
remarks	B-Mental
do	B-Agentive
usually	O
express	B-Mental

But	O
suppose	B-Mental
that	O
a	O
week	B-Mental
later	O
we	O
revert	B-BoundedEvent
to	O
the	O
incident	B-BoundedEvent
in	O
thought	B-Mental

make	B-Agentive
our	O
statement	B-Mental
again	O

And	O
suppose	B-Mental
that	O
the	O
circumstances	B-UnboundedEvent
have	O
now	O
so	O
changed	B-BoundedEvent

the	O

When	O

that	O

Now	B-Mental

That	O

as	O
Wilson	B-Animate
afterward	O
found	B-Mental

was	O
briefly	O
referred	B-Mental

a	O

She	O
soared	B-BoundedEvent
over	O
the	O

Then	O
Wilson	B-Animate
looked	B-Mental

Wilson	B-Animate

when	O
he	O
mentioned	B-Mental
this	O
to	O
the	O

said	B-Mental
nothing	B-Mental

The	O

It	O

It	O

he	O
determined	B-Mental

The	O

Wilson	B-Animate

The	O
Presiding	B-Animate

He	O

In	O

Wilson	B-Animate
stressed	B-Mental
the	O
fact	B-Mental

The	O
Presiding	B-Animate

he	O
told	B-Mental
Wilson	B-Animate

The	O

From	O

He	O
smashed	B-UnboundedEvent
it	O

When	O
the	O

``	O

the	O

wished	B-Mental

That	O

made	B-BoundedEvent
things	B-Mental

But	O
he	O
was	B-UnboundedEvent

He	O
was	O
only	O
dreaming	B-Mental

He	O
clattered	B-Mental
down	O
the	O

out	O

the	O

Somewhere	O
in	O
the	O

the	O
nigger	B-Animate

Herold	B-Animate

he	O
saw	B-Mental

had	O
fled	B-BoundedEvent

Well	O
,	O
one	O
did	O
not	O
expect	B-Mental
much	B-Mental
of	O
people	B-Object

Herold	B-Animate

He	O
unhitched	B-UnboundedEvent
his	O
horse	B-Animate

walked	B-BoundedEvent
it	O
away	O
,	O
mounted	B-BoundedEvent

and	O
spurred	B-UnboundedEvent
it	O
on	O

The	O
nigger	B-Animate
boy	B-Animate
was	B-UnboundedEvent
close	O

him	O

Then	O
the	O
nigger	B-Animate
boy	B-Animate
turned	B-BoundedEvent
back	I-BoundedEvent
and	O
he	O
was	B-UnboundedEvent
alone	O

He	O
rode	B-BoundedEvent
on	O
and	O
on	O
.	O

He	O
had	B-Mental
no	O
idea	B-Mental
where	O
he	O
was	B-UnboundedEvent

After	O
some	O
time	B-Mental
he	O
came	B-BoundedEvent
to	O
an	O
open	O
field	B-Object

An	O
open	O
field	B-Object
was	B-UnboundedEvent
better	O
than	O
a	O
building	B-Object
,	O
that	O
was	B-UnboundedEvent
for	O
sure	O
,	O
so	O
he	O
dismounted	B-BoundedEvent
,	O
turned	B-BoundedEvent
off	O
the	O
horse	B-Animate
,	O
and	O
plunged	B-UnboundedEvent
through	O
the	O
grass	B-Object
.	O

He	O
felt	B-BoundedEvent
curiously	O
sleepy	O
,	O
the	O
world	B-Object
seemed	B-Mental
far	O
away	O
;	O
he	O
knew	B-Mental
he	O
should	O
get	B-BoundedEvent
to	O
Cap	B-Animate
,	O
but	O
he	O
did	O
n't	O
know	B-Mental
how	O
.	O

He	O
was	B-UnboundedEvent
sure	O
,	O
for	O
he	O
had	O
done	B-Agentive
as	O
he	O
was	O
told	B-Mental

had	O
n't	O
he	O
?	O

Cap	B-Animate
would	O
find	B-Mental
him	O
and	O
take	B-Agentive
care	B-Agentive
of	O
him	O

So	O
choosing	B-Mental
a	O
good	O
tree	B-Object
,	O
he	O
clambered	B-BoundedEvent
up	O
into	O
it	O
,	O
found	B-Mental
a	O
comfortable	O
notch	B-Property

and	O
curled	O
up	O
in	O
it	O
to	O
sleep	B-BoundedEvent

with	O
his	O
hands	B-Object
across	O
his	O
chest	B-Object
,	O
as	O
though	O
surfeited	O
with	O
honey	B-Object

Violence	B-Agentive
always	O
made	B-BoundedEvent
him	O
tired	O

but	O
he	O
was	B-UnboundedEvent
not	O
frightened	O

In	O

It	O
was	B-UnboundedEvent
a	O

him	O

he	O
did	O
not	O
bother	B-Agentive

it	O

him	O

On	O

tonight	O

That	O

The	O

He	O

about	O

if	O
he	O

it	O

there	O
were	B-UnboundedEvent
still	O
moments	B-Mental
when	O
he	O

all	O

that	O

They	O

Wilkes	B-Animate

Laura	B-Animate

The	O

Since	O

one	O

suited	B-UnboundedEvent
her	O
as	O

any	O

so	O
she	O
was	B-UnboundedEvent

It	O

the	O

they	O

The	O

The	O

At	O
the	O

the	O

the	O

Yet	O
even	O
that	O
explosion	B-BoundedEvent
did	O
not	O
mean	B-Mental

going	B-BoundedEvent

Washington	B-Object

the	O

Then	O
the	O

``	O

Booth	B-Animate

Behind	O
him	O
billowed	B-BoundedEvent
a	O

They	O

They	O

not	O

They	O

sitting	B-UnboundedEvent
too	O
long	O
to	O
be	B-UnboundedEvent
able	O
to	O
stand	B-BoundedEvent
up	I-BoundedEvent

The	O

leapt	B-BoundedEvent
from	O
the	O

almost	O
lost	B-Mental

Harry	B-Animate

His	O

The	O
figure	B-Object
was	B-UnboundedEvent

theatrically	O
dressed	O

that	O
it	O
was	O
as	O

it	O
also	O

it	O

Harry	B-Animate

The	O
furor	B-Mental

that	O

I	O
never	O

heard	B-Mental

another	O

this	O
section	B-Object

I	O

the	O

the	B-Animate

Cousin	B-Animate

early	O
in	O
the	O
morning	B-Mental
,	O
and	O
moving	B-BoundedEvent
at	O
a	O
much	O
brisker	O
pace	B-Mental
it	O
had	O
still	O
taken	B-Mental
half	B-Mental

we	O

it	O

He	O
drew	B-Agentive

In	O
any	O

He	O

The	O

on	O
one	O

the	O

The	O

From	O

a	O

Two	O

At	O

the	O

There	O

Watson	B-Animate
hardly	O
looked	B-Mental

him	O

The	O

come	B-BoundedEvent
floundering	B-BoundedEvent
aboard	O
the	O
flat-bottomed	O

at	O
the	O

Someone	B-Animate

hauled	B-UnboundedEvent
him	O
over	O
the	O
side	B-Object

he	O
had	O
remained	B-BoundedEvent

while	O
they	O

An	O
officer	B-Animate
with	O
a	O
squad	B-Object
of	O
men	B-Animate
had	O
been	O
waiting	B-UnboundedEvent
on	O
the	O
bank	B-Object

The	O
men	B-Animate
in	O
the	O
boats	B-Object
had	O
started	B-BoundedEvent
yelling	B-Mental
happily	O
at	O
first	O

of	O
the	O
officer	B-Animate
,	O
two	O

them	O
calling	B-Mental

Billy	B-Animate

When	O
the	O

had	O
touched	B-UnboundedEvent

the	O
weaker	O
ones	O
and	O
the	O
two	O
wounded	O
men	B-Animate

been	O
lifted	B-BoundedEvent

carried	B-UnboundedEvent
away	I-UnboundedEvent

the	O
soldiers	B-Animate

Watson	B-Animate
had	O
presented	B-Mental
his	O
pouch	B-Object
and	O
been	O
led	B-BoundedEvent
to	O
the	O
bombproof	B-Object

The	O
officer	B-Animate
had	O
told	B-Mental
him	O
that	O
both	O
lists	B-Mental

be	O
checked	B-Mental

Watson	B-Animate
had	O
given	B-Mental
his	O

asked	B-Mental
for	O
a	O
safe-conduct	B-Mental

The	O
officer	B-Animate
,	O
surprised	O
,	O
said	B-Mental
he	O
would	O
have	O
to	O
see	B-Mental

Watson	B-Animate
had	O
nodded	B-Mental
absently	O
and	O
muttered	B-Mental
that	O
he	O
would	O
check	B-Mental
the	O
lists	B-Mental
himself	O
later	O
.	O

He	O
had	O
peered	B-Mental
through	O
the	O
darkness	B-UnboundedEvent
at	O
the	O
rampart	B-Object

The	O
men	B-Animate
he	O
would	O
take	B-BoundedEvent
back	I-BoundedEvent
across	O
the	O
river	B-Object
stood	B-UnboundedEvent
there	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
turned	B-BoundedEvent
away	I-BoundedEvent
from	O
them	O

He	O
wanted	B-Mental
no	O
part	B-UnboundedEvent

the	O
emotions	B-Mental
of	O
the	O
exchange	B-Mental

no	O
memory	B-Mental
of	O
the	O
joy	B-Mental

gratitude	B-Mental
that	O
other	O
men	B-Animate

He	O
had	O
hoped	B-Mental
to	O
be	B-UnboundedEvent
alone	O
in	O
the	O
bombproof	B-Object

but	O
the	O
soldier	B-Animate

followed	B-BoundedEvent
him	O

Though	O
Watson	B-Animate
carefully	O
ignored	B-Mental
the	O
man	B-Animate
,	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
deny	B-Mental
his	O
presence	B-UnboundedEvent

Perhaps	O
it	O
would	O
be	B-UnboundedEvent
better	O
to	O
speak	O
to	O
him	O

since	O
silence	B-Property
could	O
not	O
exorcise	B-UnboundedEvent
his	O
form	B-Object

Watson	B-Animate
glanced	B-Mental
briefly	O
at	O
him	O

seeing	B-Mental
only	O
a	O

behind	O
the	O

-	O
We	O

If	O
my	O

I	O
may	O
be	B-Mental

half	B-Mental

The	O

a	O
curious	O

muffled	O
voice	B-Mental

his	O

Watson	B-Animate
turned	B-BoundedEvent

did	O
not	O

He	O

It	O

Watson	B-Animate
decided	B-Mental

The	O
stiff	O
figure	B-Object

the	O

stooping	B-BoundedEvent

the	O

He	O

the	O

But	O
he	O
groped	B-UnboundedEvent

His	O
lack	B-UnboundedEvent

success	B-Agentive
steadily	O
eroded	B-BoundedEvent
his	O

He	O
stopped	B-UnboundedEvent

leaned	B-UnboundedEvent
against	I-UnboundedEvent
the	O

She	O
enjoyed	B-Mental

it	O

her	O
that	O

Now	O

Stowey	B-Animate

Then	O
she	O

yet	O

now	O
that	O
she	O

a	O

this	O

the	O

in	O
a	O
moment	O
she	O
found	B-Mental

to	O
wait	B-Mental

Lucretia	B-Animate
to	O
come	B-BoundedEvent
with	O
her	O
guests	B-Animate

She	O
went	B-BoundedEvent
into	I-BoundedEvent
the	O
living	B-Object

turned	B-UnboundedEvent
on	I-UnboundedEvent
three	O
lamps	B-Object

then	O
back	O
into	O
the	O
kitchen	B-Object

she	O
turned	B-UnboundedEvent

She	O
knew	B-Mental
she	O
was	O
feeling	B-Mental

inwardly	O

They	O

after	O
all	O

for	O
any	O

How	O
could	O
it	O
have	O
been	B-UnboundedEvent
thirty	O
years	B-Mental
already	O

she	O
wondered	B-Mental
?	O

But	O
yes	O
,	O
nineteen	B-Mental
plus	O
thirty	B-Mental
was	B-UnboundedEvent
forty-nine	O
,	O
and	O
she	O
was	B-UnboundedEvent
forty-nine	O
and	O
she	O
had	O
been	O
married	B-Agentive
at	O
nineteen	B-Mental

She	O
stood	B-BoundedEvent
still	I-BoundedEvent
over	O
the	O
leg	B-Object
of	I-Object
lamb	I-Object
,	O
rubbing	B-UnboundedEvent
herbs	B-Object
into	O
it	O
,	O
quite	O
suddenly	O
conscious	O
of	O
a	O
nausea	B-UnboundedEvent
in	O
her	O
stomach	B-Object
and	O
a	O
feeling	B-Mental
of	O
wrath	B-Mental

a	O
sensation	B-Mental
of	O
violence	B-Agentive
that	O
started	B-BoundedEvent
her	O
shivering	B-UnboundedEvent

But	O
they	O
all	O
said	B-Mental
,	O
``	O
No	O

your	O

There	O
was	B-UnboundedEvent

in	O
the	O

House	O
(	O
where	O
the	O
Albright	B-Animate

get	B-Mental
a	O
house	B-Object

a	O

So	O
when	O
the	O
Big	O
House	O
filled	B-BoundedEvent
up	I-BoundedEvent
and	O
ran	B-BoundedEvent
over	I-BoundedEvent
,	O
the	O
sisters-in-law	B-Animate

beds	B-Object

everyone	O

And	O
there	O
was	B-UnboundedEvent
still	O
not	O
anything	O
that	O
Linda	B-Animate
Kay	I-Animate
could	O
do	B-Agentive

So	O
Linda	B-Animate
Kay	I-Animate
gave	B-Agentive
up	I-Agentive
asking	B-Mental

and	O
accepted	B-Mental
her	O
reprieve	B-UnboundedEvent

Without	O
saying	B-Mental
so	O
,	O
she	O
was	B-UnboundedEvent
really	O
grateful	O

for	O
to	O
attend	B-Agentive
the	O
dying	O

something	O
she	O
had	O
never	O
experienced	B-Mental

and	O
certainly	O
had	O
not	O
imagined	B-Agentive
when	O
she	O
thought	B-Mental
of	I-Mental
the	O
duties	B-Agentive
she	O
would	O
have	B-Mental
as	O
Bobby	B-Animate
Joe	I-Animate
's	O
wife	B-Animate

She	O
had	O
made	B-Agentive
curtains	B-Object
for	O
all	O
the	O
windows	B-Object
of	O
her	O
little	O
house	B-Object

and	O
she	O
had	O
kept	B-UnboundedEvent
it	O
spotless	O
and	O
neat	O
,	O
shabby	O
as	O
it	O
was	B-UnboundedEvent
,	O
and	O
cooked	B-BoundedEvent
good	O
meals	B-Object
for	O
Bobby	B-Animate
Joe	I-Animate

She	O
had	O
done	B-Agentive
all	O
the	O
things	B-Agentive
she	O
had	O
promised	B-Mental
herself	O
she	O
would	O
do	B-Agentive
,	O
but	O
she	O
had	O
not	O
thought	B-Mental
of	I-Mental
this	O
.	O

People	B-Object
died	B-BoundedEvent
,	O
she	O
would	O
have	O
said	B-Mental
,	O
in	O
hospitals	B-Object
,	O
or	O
in	O
cars	B-Object
on	O
the	O
highway	B-Object
at	O
night	B-Mental
.	O

Bobby	B-Animate
Joe	I-Animate
was	B-UnboundedEvent
gone	O
all	O
day	B-Mental
now	O
,	O
not	O
coming	B-BoundedEvent
in	I-BoundedEvent
for	O
dinner	B-Object
and	O
sometimes	O
not	O
for	O
supper	B-Object
.	O

When	O
they	O
first	O
married	B-Agentive
he	O
had	O
been	O
working	B-Agentive
in	O
the	O
fields	B-Object
all	O
day	B-Mental
,	O
and	O
she	O
would	O
get	B-BoundedEvent
in	I-BoundedEvent
the	O
car	B-Object
and	O
drive	B-BoundedEvent
to	O
wherever	O
he	O
was	O
working	B-Agentive
,	O
to	O
take	B-BoundedEvent
him	O
a	O
fresh	O
hot	O
meal	B-Object
.	O

Now	B-Mental
there	O
was	B-UnboundedEvent
no	O
work	B-Agentive
in	O
the	O
fields	B-Object
,	O
nor	O
would	O
there	O
be	B-UnboundedEvent
till	O
it	O
rained	B-BoundedEvent
,	O
and	O
she	O
did	O
not	O
know	B-Mental
where	O
he	O
went	B-BoundedEvent
.	O

Not	O
that	O
she	O
complained	B-Mental
,	O
or	O
had	B-Mental
any	O
cause	B-Mental
to	O
.	O

Four	B-Mental
or	O
five	B-Mental
of	O
the	O
cousins	B-Animate
from	O
East	B-Object
Texas	I-Object
were	B-UnboundedEvent
about	O
his	O
age	B-Property
,	O
so	O
naturally	O
they	O
ran	B-BoundedEvent
around	I-BoundedEvent
together	O
.	O

There	O
was	B-UnboundedEvent
no	O
reason	B-Mental
for	O
her	O
to	O
ask	B-Mental
what	O
they	O
did	B-Agentive
.	O

Thus	O
a	O
new	O
pattern	B-Agentive
of	O
days	B-Mental
began	B-BoundedEvent
to	O
develop	B-BoundedEvent
,	O
for	O
Granny	B-Animate
Albright	I-Animate
did	O
not	O
die	B-BoundedEvent
.	O

She	O
lay	B-UnboundedEvent
still	O
on	O
the	O
bed	B-Object
,	O
her	O
head	B-Object
hardly	O
denting	B-UnboundedEvent
the	O
pillow	B-Object
;	O
sometimes	O
she	O
opened	B-UnboundedEvent
her	O
eyes	B-Object
and	O
looked	B-Mental
around	I-Mental
,	O
and	O
sometimes	O
she	O
took	B-Agentive
a	O
little	O
milk	B-Object
or	O
soup	B-Object
.	O

They	O
stopped	B-UnboundedEvent
expecting	B-Mental
her	O
to	O
die	B-BoundedEvent
the	O
next	O
minute	B-Mental
,	O
but	O
only	O
in	O
the	O
next	O
day	B-Mental
or	O
two	O
.	O

Those	O
who	O
had	O
driven	B-BoundedEvent
hundreds	B-Mental
of	O
miles	B-Mental
for	O
the	O
burial	B-BoundedEvent
would	O
not	O
go	B-BoundedEvent
home	I-BoundedEvent
,	O
for	O
she	O
might	O
die	B-BoundedEvent
any	O
time	B-BoundedEvent
;	O
but	O
they	O
might	O
as	O
well	O
unpack	B-UnboundedEvent
their	O
suitcases	B-Object
,	O
for	O
she	O
might	O
linger	B-UnboundedEvent
on	O
.	O

So	O
the	O
pattern	B-Agentive
was	O
established	B-Agentive
.	O

When	O
Linda	B-Animate
Kay	I-Animate
had	O
put	B-UnboundedEvent
up	I-UnboundedEvent

breakfast	B-Object

mopped	O
her	O
linoleum	B-Object

she	O
would	O
go	O
to	O
the	O
Big	O
House	O
.	O

There	O
was	B-UnboundedEvent
not	O
anything	O
she	O
could	O
do	B-Agentive
there	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
was	B-UnboundedEvent
where	O
everyone	O
was	B-UnboundedEvent
,	O
or	O
would	O
be	B-UnboundedEvent
.	O

Bobby	B-Animate
Joe	I-Animate

the	O

would	O
come	B-Agentive

say	B-Mental
``	O

sit	B-UnboundedEvent

the	O

The	O

be	B-UnboundedEvent

at	O
noon	B-Mental

and	O
maybe	O
rest	B-BoundedEvent
for	O
a	O
time	B-Mental
before	O
they	O
took	B-BoundedEvent
their	O

off	O
to	O
the	O

drove	B-BoundedEvent
down	O
the	O
road	B-Object
towards	O

The	O
women	B-Animate

The	O

around	O
the	O
house	B-Object
or	O
sat	B-UnboundedEvent
in	O
the	O
living	B-Object
room	I-Object
,	O
sounded	B-Mental
like	O
chickens	B-Object
shut	O
up	O
in	O
a	O

for	O
the	O
night	B-Mental

The	O

the	O

Off	O

her	O
door	B-Object

that	O
the	O

The	O

the	O

at	O

in	O
the	O

the	O

I	O
remember	B-Mental
standing	B-UnboundedEvent

watching	B-Agentive

She	O

dark	O

two	O

It	O
made	B-BoundedEvent
her	O
look	B-Mental
sweet	O
and	O
schoolgirlish	O
,	O
I	O
was	B-UnboundedEvent
excited	O
to	O

her	O

but	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
know	B-Mental

to	O
express	B-Mental
it	O

Yet	O
a	O
moment	B-Mental
did	O
come	B-BoundedEvent
that	O
night	B-Mental
when	O
the	O
adventurous	O
letter	B-Animate
writer	I-Animate

fantasist	B-Animate
seemed	B-Mental
to	O
stride	O
off	O
my	O

out	O
of	O
my	O

It	O

we	O
were	O
playing	B-Agentive

and	O
Jessica	B-Animate

I	O
called	B-Mental
on	I-Mental
to	O
kiss	B-UnboundedEvent

of	O
the	O

We	O
blushed	B-BoundedEvent

were	O
flustered	B-Mental

and	O
it	O
turned	B-UnboundedEvent
out	I-UnboundedEvent
to	O
be	B-UnboundedEvent
the	O
fleetest	O
brush	B-BoundedEvent
of	O
lips	B-Object
upon	O

The	O
kiss	B-Agentive
outraged	B-Mental
our	O
friends	B-Animate
but	O
it	O
was	O
done	B-Agentive
and	O
meanwhile	O
had	O
released	B-UnboundedEvent
in	O
me	O
all	O
the	O
remote	O

exciting	O
premonitions	B-Mental
of	O
lust	B-Mental

all	O
the	O

had	O
imagined	O
a	O

It	O
was	B-UnboundedEvent
at	O
that	O
party	B-Object
that	O
,	O
finally	O
overcoming	B-Agentive
my	O
timidity	B-Mental

inspired	B-Mental

tales	B-Mental
only	O
half	O
understood	O

overheard	B-Mental
among	O
older	O
boys	B-Animate
,	O
I	O
asked	B-Mental
Jessie	B-Animate
to	O
spend	B-UnboundedEvent
New	B-Mental
Year's	I-Mental
Eve	I-Mental
with	O
me	O
.	O

Lovingly	O
,	O
she	O
accepted	B-Mental

and	O
so	O
great	O
was	B-UnboundedEvent
my	O
emotion	B-Mental
that	O
all	O
I	O
could	O
think	B-Mental

``	O
You	O

Later	O

we	O
agreed	B-Mental

think	B-Mental
of	I-Mental
how	O
we	O
wished	B-Mental
to	O
spend	B-UnboundedEvent
that	O
night	B-Mental

We	O
would	O
write	B-Mental

one	O
another	O
and	O
make	B-Mental
a	O

She	O

Among	O
my	O

during	O
the	O

I	O
bragged	B-Mental

swaggered	B-BoundedEvent

pompously	O
described	B-Mental
my	O
impending	O

But	O
though	O
I	O
boasted	B-Mental
and	O
gave	B-UnboundedEvent
off	I-UnboundedEvent
a	O
dapper	O
front	B-Mental
,	O
I	O
was	B-UnboundedEvent
beneath	O
it	O
all	O

It	O
would	O
be	B-UnboundedEvent
the	O
first	O

I	O
had	B-Mental

discussed	B-Mental
when	O
alone	O
with	O
a	O

or	O
how	O
one	O

Should	O
I	O

Was	O
it	O

I	O

All	O
this	O

the	O

the	O

However	O
,	O
the	O

only	O
go	B-Agentive
so	O
far	O
if	O
the	O
attitude	B-Mental
of	O
the	O

Rather	O
we	O

Here	O
again	O
we	O
run	B-UnboundedEvent
