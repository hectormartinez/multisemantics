great	O
,	O
we	O
will	O
merely	O
discuss	B-Mental
it	O

First	O
,	O
we	O
realize	B-Mental
that	O
a	O
pure	O

does	O
not	O
exist	B-UnboundedEvent

But	O
,	O
for	O

we	O
have	B-Mental

can	O
be	O
considered	B-Mental

such	O

For	O
example	O
,	O
there	O
are	B-UnboundedEvent
persons	B-Animate

who	O

we	O

that	O
a	O

a	O

in	O
these	O
