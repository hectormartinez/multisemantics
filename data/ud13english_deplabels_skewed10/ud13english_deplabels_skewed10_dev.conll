Several	0
years	2

I	3
developed	0
a	3
short	1
paper	1

pencil	0
screening	0
test	1
which	2
,	3
in	3
a	3
small	1
pilot	1
study	0
,	3
discriminated	0
between	1
ADHD	0
,	3
LD	0
,	3
and	3
control	1
subjects	0
.	3

I	3
recently	1
converted	0
this	2
test	1
to	3
an	2
online	1
test	1
in	3
order	1
to	3
norm	0
it	3
to	3
a	3
larger	1
population	1
and	3
,	3
subsequently	0
,	3
to	3
make	2
it	3

to	3
any	2
one	2
who	2
has	2
access	1
to	3
a	3
computer	1
and	3
the	3
Internet	0

The	2
test	1
itself	1
is	3
what	2
is	3
called	2
a	3
substitution	0
test	1
.	3

It	2
has	2
two	2
parts	1
,	3
both	1
of	3
which	2
are	3
timed	0
for	3
90	0
seconds	0
each	1
and	3
the	3
differential	0
between	1
the	3
resulting	0
two	2
scores	0
determines	0
the	3
likelihood	0
of	3
having	1
a	3
learning	0

or	2
attention	1
deficit	0
disorder	0
.	3

I	3
am	2
in	3
need	2
of	3

hope	1
you	3

take	2
it	3

test	1

along	1
with	3
an	2
information	1
form	1

available	1
at	2
:	2

I	3
think	2
a	3
test	1
like	2
this	2
one	2
is	3
much	2
needed	1
.	3

A	2
person	1
can	2
take	2
it	3
directly	1
instead	1
of	3
others	1
