hear	2

belief	1
that	4
we	3
have	4
not	4
enough	2
generalists	0
who	3
can	3

problem	2
of	5
the	6
optimum	0
balance	2
in	5
the	6
relative	1
numbers	2

generalists	0
and	5
specialists	1
can	3
be	4
investigated	1
on	4
a	5
communicative	0
network	1
basis	2
.	5

Since	2
the	6
difficulty	1
of	5
drawing	1
the	6
net	0
is	4
great	3
,	5
we	3
will	3
merely	2
discuss	1
it	4
.	5

First	2
,	5
we	3
realize	1
that	4
a	5
pure	1
specialist	1
does	3
not	4
exist	1
.	5

But	3
,	5
for	4
practical	1
purposes	1
,	5
we	3
have	4
people	3
who	3
can	3
be	4
considered	2
as	4
such	3
.	5

For	3
example	2
,	5
there	3
are	4
persons	1
who	3
are	4
in	5
physical	2
science	1
,	5
in	5
the	6
field	2
of	5
mineralogy	0
,	5
trained	1
in	5
crystallography	0
,	5
who	3
use	3
only	3
X-rays	0
,	5
applying	0
only	3
the	6
powder	1
technique	1
of	5
X-ray	0
diffraction	0
,	5
to	5
clay	1
minerals	1
only	3
,	5
and	5
who	3
have	4
spent	1
the	6
last	3
fifteen	1
years	3
concentrating	1
on	4
the	6
montmorillonites	0
;	4
or	4
persons	1

But	3
before	3
I	4
try	2
to	5
diagnose	0
it	4
,	5
I	4
would	4
offer	1
other	3
evidence	2
.	5

I	4
will	3
mention	1
two	3
volumes	1
of	5
specific	2
comment	1
on	4
this	4
malaise	0
that	4
appeared	2
last	3
year	2
.	5

The	4
earlier	2
of	5
them	3
was	4
an	4
unofficial	0
enterprise	0
,	5
sponsored	1
by	4
Life	1
magazine	1
,	5
under	3
the	6
title	1
of	5
the	6
National	2
purpose	2
.	5

The	4
contributors	0
to	5
this	4
testament	0
were	4
all	4
well-known	1
:	3

a	5
former	2
Democratic	1
candidate	1
for	4
President	1
,	5
a	5
New	2

What	3
I	4
want	2
to	5
point	2
out	3
here	3
is	4
that	4
all	4
of	5
them	3
are	4
ex	0
liberals	1
,	5
or	4
modified	0
liberals	1
,	5
with	4
perhaps	2
one	4
exception	1
.	5

I	4
suppose	1
we	3
might	3
classify	0
Billy	0
Graham	0
as	4
an	4
old	3
liberal	1
.	5

And	3
I	4
would	4
further	2
note	1
that	4
they	4
all	4
-	4
with	4
one	4
exception	1
again	3
-	4
sang	1
in	5
one	4
key	1
or	4
another	3
the	6
same	3
song	1
.	5

Its	1
refrain	1
was	4
:	3
``	4
Let	2
us	3
return	2
to	5
the	6
individualistic	0
democracy	0
of	5
our	3
forefathers	0
for	4
our	3
salvation	1
''	4
.	5

Adlai	0
Stevenson	0
expressed	1
some	3
reservations	0
about	3
this	4
return	2
.	5

Others	0
invoked	0
technology	0
and	5

Only	2
Walter	0
Lippman	0
envisioned	0
the	6
possibility	1
of	5
our	3
having	2
``	4
outlived	0
most	3
of	5
what	3
we	3
used	3
to	5
regard	2
as	4
the	6
program	2
of	5
our	3
national	2
purposes	1
''	4
.	5

But	3
the	6
most	3
notable	0
thing	2
about	3
the	6
incantation	0
of	5
these	3
ex	0
liberals	1
was	4
that	4
the	6
one-time	0
shibboleth	0
of	5
socialism	0
was	4
conspicuously	0
absent	1
.	5

The	4
second	2
specific	2
comment	1
was	4
the	6
report	2
of	5
Eisenhower	0
's	4
Commission	0
on	4
National	2
Goals	0
,	5
titled	0
Goals	0
For	3
Americans	1
.	5

They	3
,	5
perhaps	2
,	5
gave	2
the	6
pitch	0
of	5
their	4
position	2
in	5
the	6
preface	0
where	3
it	4
was	4
said	3
that	4
Eisenhower	0
requested	0
that	4
the	6
Commission	0
be	4
administered	0
by	4
the	6
American	3
Assembly	0
of	5
Columbia	0
University	1
,	5
because	3
it	4
was	4
non-partisan	0
.	5

The	4
Commission	0
seems	2
to	5
represent	1
the	6
viewpoint	1
of	5
what	3
I	4
would	4
call	2
the	6
unconscious	0
liberal	1
,	5
but	4
not	4
unconscious	0
enough	2
,	5
to	5
invoke	0
the	6
now	3
taboo	0
symbolism	0
of	5
socialism	0
.	5

And	3
here	3
again	3
we	3
hear	2
the	6
same	3
refrain	1
mentioned	1
above	2
:	3
``	4
The	4
paramount	0
goal	1
of	5
the	6
United	2

and	5
their	4
program	2

to	5
be	4

But	3
it	4
is	4
the	6
need	2
to	5
undertake	0
these	3
testaments	0
that	4
I	4
would	4
submit	0
here	3
as	4
symptom	0
of	5
the	6
common	2
man	3

And	3
let	2
me	3
add	1
Murray	0
's	4
new	3
book	2
as	4
another	3
symptom	0
of	5
it	4
,	5
particularly	2
so	3
in	5
view	2
of	5
the	6
attention	2

gave	2
it	4

it	4

out	3

though	2
I	4
may	3
add	1
,	5
with	4
considerably	1
more	3

I	4
will	3
reserve	0
discussion	1

it	4

moment	2

however	2
,	5
to	5
return	2
to	5

As	3
symptomatic	0
of	5
the	6
common	2
man	3
's	4
malaise	0

he	4
is	4
most	3
significant	1

liberal	1
and	5
a	5
Catholic	2

elected	1
by	4
the	6
skin	1

Does	1
that	4
not	4
suggest	1
to	5
you	4
an	4
uncertain	1
and	5
uneasy	1
,	5
not	4
to	5
say	3
confused	1
,	5
state	2
of	5
the	6
public	2
mind	2
?	4

What	3
is	4
the	6
common	2
man	3
's	4
complaint	0
?	4

Let	2
's	4
take	3
a	5
panoramic	0
look	2
back	3
over	3
the	6
course	2
we	3
have	4
come	3
.	5

Has	0
not	4
that	4
way	3
been	4
lit	1
always	2
by	4
the	6
lamp	1
of	5
liberalism	0
up	3
until	2
the	6
turning	1
back	3
under	3
Eisenhower	0
?	4

And	3
the	6
basic	2
character	2
of	5
that	4
liberalism	0
has	3
been	4
spiritual	1
rather	2
than	3
economic	2
.	5

Ralph	0
Gabriel	1
gave	2
it	4
the	6
name	2
of	5
Protestant	2
philosophy	1
of	5
Progress	0
.	5

But	3
there	3
's	4
a	5
subjective	1
side	2
to	5
that	4
utopian	0
outlook	1
.	5

Does	1
our	3
society	2
have	4
a	5
runaway	0
,	5
uncontrollable	0
growth	2
of	5
technology	0
which	4
may	3
end	2
our	3
civilization	1
,	5
or	4
a	5
normal	2
,	5
healthy	1
growth	2
?	4

Here	2
there	3
may	3
be	4
an	4
analogy	1
with	4
cancer	1
:	3
we	3
can	3
detect	0
cancers	0
by	4
their	4
rapidly	1
accelerating	0
growth	2
,	5
determinable	0
only	3
when	3
related	2
to	5
the	6
more	3
normal	2
rate	2
of	5
healthy	1
growth	2
.	5

Should	0
the	6
accelerating	0
growth	2
of	5
technology	0
then	3
warn	0
us	3
?	4

Noting	0
such	3
evidence	2
is	4
the	6
first	3
step	2
;	4
and	5
almost	2
the	6
only	3
``	4
cure	1
''	4
is	4
early	2
detection	0
and	5
removal	1
.	5

One	2
way	3
to	5
determine	1
whether	2
we	3
have	4
so	3
dangerous	1
a	5
technology	0
would	4
be	4
to	5
check	1
the	6
strength	2
of	5
our	3
society	2
's	4
organs	1
to	5
see	3
if	3
their	4
functioning	0
is	4
as	4
healthy	1
as	4
before	3
.	5

So	2
an	4
objective	1
look	2
at	4
our	3
present	2
procedures	1
may	3
move	2
us	3
to	5
consider	2
seriously	1
this	4
possibly	1
analogous	1
situation	2
.	5

In	3
any	3
event	2
,	5
whether	2
society	2
may	3
have	4
cancer	1
,	5
or	4
merely	2
a	5
virus	1
infection	0
,	5
the	6
``	4
disease	1
''	4
,	5
we	3
shall	2
find	2
,	5
is	4
political	2
,	5
economical	1
,	5
social	2
,	5
and	5
even	3
medical	2
.	5

Have	2
not	4
our	3
physical	2
abilities	0
already	2
deteriorated	0
because	3
of	5
the	6
more	3
sedentary	0
lives	1
we	3
are	4
now	3
living	2
?	4

Hence	1
the	6
prime	1
issue	1
,	5
as	4
I	4
see	3
it	4
,	5
is	4
whether	2
a	5
democratic	1
or	4
free	2
society	2
can	3
master	1
technology	0
for	4
the	6
benefit	1
of	5
mankind	0
,	5
or	4
whether	2
technology	0
will	3
rule	1
and	5
develop	1
its	3
own	3
society	2
compatible	0
with	4
its	3
own	3
needs	2
as	4
a	5
force	2
of	5
nature	2
.	5

We	3
are	4
already	2
committed	1
to	5
establishing	0
man	3
's	4
supremacy	0
over	3
nature	2
and	5
everywhere	1
on	4
earth	2
,	5
not	4
merely	2
in	5
the	6
limited	2
social	2
political	2
economical	1
context	0
we	3
are	4
fond	0
of	5
today	2
.	5

Otherwise	1
,	5
we	3
go	3
on	4
endlessly	0
trying	2
to	5
draw	1
the	6
line	2
,	5
color	2
and	5
other	3
,	5
as	4
to	5
which	4
kind	2
of	5
man	3
we	3
wish	1
to	5
see	3
dominate	0
.	5

We	3
have	4
proved	1
so	3
able	2
to	5
solve	0
technological	0
problems	2
that	4
to	5
contend	0
we	3
cannot	2
realize	1
a	5
universal	1
goal	1
in	5
the	6
immediate	1
future	2
is	4
to	5
be	4
extremely	1
shortsighted	0
,	5
if	3
nothing	2
else	2
.	5

We	3
must	3
believe	2
we	3
have	4
the	6
ability	1
to	5
affect	1
our	3
own	3
destinies	0
:	3
otherwise	1
why	2
try	2
anything	2
?	4

So	2
in	5
these	3
pages	1
the	6
term	1
``	4
technology	0
''	4
is	4
used	3
to	5
include	2
any	3
and	5
all	4
means	2
which	4
could	3
amplify	0
,	5
project	1
,	5
or	4
augment	0
man	3
's	4
control	2
over	3
himself	3
and	5
over	3
other	3
men	3
.	5

Naturally	0
this	4
includes	1
all	4
communication	1

,	5
e.	0
g.	0
languages	0
,	5
or	4
any	3
social	2
,	5
political	2

economic	2
or	4
religious	2
structures	1
employed	1
for	4
such	3
control	2

Properly	0
mindful	0
of	5
all	4
the	6
cultures	0
in	5
existence	2
today	2
throughout	2
the	6
world	3
,	5
we	3
must	3
employ	0
these	3
resources	1
without	2
war	2
or	4
violent	1
revolution	1
.	5

If	3
we	3
were	4
creating	1
a	5
wholly	1
new	3
society	2
,	5
we	3
could	3
insist	1
that	4
our	3
social	2

economic	2
and	5
philosophic	0
institutions	1
foster	0
rather	2
than	3
hamper	0

But	3
we	3
cannot	2
start	2
off	3
with	4
a	5
clean	1
slate	0
.	5

So	2
we	3
must	3
first	3
analyze	0
our	3
present	2
institutions	1
with	4
respect	2
to	5
the	6
effect	2
of	5
each	3

His	3

it	4
is	4
no	3

assume	1
that	4
he	4

spent	1
time	3

himself	3

history	2

that	4
he	4

in	5
looking	2
at	4
Faulkner	0
against	3
his	4
background	1

South	2
,	5
it	4
is	4
important	2
not	4
to	5
lose	1
the	6
broader	1
perspective	1

His	3
earliest	1
work	3
reflected	1

influences	0

writers	1

Evidence	0
is	4
plentiful	0
that	4
early	2

later	2
also	3
he	4
has	3

His	3
repeated	1
experimentation	1

testifies	0
to	5
an	4
independence	1

mind	2

an	4
originality	0

it	4

My	2

Accordingly	1
we	3

In	3

we	3
have	4
come	3

recognize	1
that	4

Here	2
we	3
may	3
observe	1
that	4

The	4

always	2

Let	2
us	3
survey	0
for	4
a	5
moment	2
the	6
development	2

modern	2

turning	1
our	3
attention	2
from	4
the	6

dwelling	0
finally	2
on	4

We	3
may	3
thus	2
trace	1
the	6
notion	1
of	5
individual	2
autonomy	0
from	4
its	3
manifestation	0
in	5
religious	2
practice	1
and	5
theological	1
reflection	1
through	3
practical	1
politics	1
and	5
political	2
theory	2
into	3
literature	2

the	6
arts	1

Finally	1
we	3
may	3
note	1
that	4
the	6
idea	2
appears	2
in	5

theory	2
where	3
its	3
influence	2

at	4

No	2

deny	1
that	4
such	3
broad	1

are	4
of	5
great	3

interest	2

the	6
