We	3

because	3

that	4

I	4

Eventually	0

more	3

in	5

after	3

she	3
asked	2

``	4

At	2
first	3
I	4
did	3
not	4
know	3
what	3

I	4
thought	3

Then	2
I	4

At	2

when	3

began	2

emerge	1

more	3
upon	2
the	6

she	3
muttered	1
in	5
a	5

to	5
herself	2

``	4
I	4

I	4
could	3

her	3
about	3

but	4
a	5
few	3
seconds	1
later	2
she	3
was	4
standing	2
directly	1
across	2
the	6

from	4
me	3

looking	2
me	3
in	5

``	4

Again	1
,	5
I	4
at	4
first	3
misconstrued	0
this	4
disconcertingly	0
intense	1
communication	1

and	5
I	4
quickly	1
cast	1
through	3
my	3

account	2

her	3
being	3
able	2

speak	2

with	4

of	5

held	2
by	4
my	3

Then	2
I	4

``	4

felt	2

``	4

She	3
clearly	2

Two	1

the	6
addition	2

of	5
complete	2

rather	2

single	2
forms	2
and	5
the	6
application	1
of	5
a	5
single	2
change	2
to	5
more	3
than	3
one	4
dictionary	0
form	2
.	5

The	4
former	2

intended	1
to	5
decrease	1
the	6
amount	2

The	4
latter	2
is	4
useful	1
for	4
modifying	0
information	2
about	3
some	3
or	4
all	4
forms	2
of	5

reducing	1

Applying	0
the	6
techniques	1
developed	2

for	4
generating	0
a	5

from	4

form	2

,	5
we	3

add	1
all	4

to	5
the	6
dictionary	0
at	4
once	2

An	2
extension	1

permit	1
entering	0
a	5

Thus	2

one	4
can	3
think	2
of	5
a	5
dictionary	0
entry	0
as	4
a	5
word	2
rather	2
than	3
a	5
form	2

If	3

grouped	0
together	2

the	6
dictionary	0

a	5
considerable	1
reduction	1
in	5
the	6
amount	2

possible	2

For	3
example	2
,	5
the	6
inflected	0
forms	2

insofar	0

(	3
Indeed	1

the	6
set	2

can	3
be	4
replaced	1
by	4
the	6
name	2

a	5
set	2

The	4

Similarly	1

for	4
the	6
forms	2

not	4
vary	1

the	6

it	4

This	3
can	3
only	3
be	4
for	4
one	4
of	5
two	3
reasons	1

either	2
the	6

If	3
,	5
as	4
I	4
suspect	1

the	6

largely	1

then	3
development	2

One	2

is	4
the	6
relative	1
difficulty	1
of	5
analysis	1

This	3

both	3
divert	0
the	6
attention	2

uninitiate	0
and	5
cause	2
confusion	1
for	4
the	6

The	4

disentangle	0
the	6

Of	2

something	2

both	3

But	3
in	5

the	6

is	4
a	5
small	3
thing	2
added	2
onto	1
basic	2
linguistic	0
features	2
of	5
greater	2
magnitude	1

With	2
tone	1

any	3

While	1

no	3

whether	2

any	3

there	3

Again	1
,	5
one	4
major	2
difficulty	1
is	4
the	6
local	2
focus	1

A	3

the	6

If	3
there	3

,	5
many	3

be	4
expected	2

Another	2
problem	2
is	4
who	3
will	3
pay	2
for	4
the	6
training	2
.	5

Local	0

are	4
hard	2

Even	2

find	2
it	4

unless	1
a	5

taking	2
the	6

but	4
their	4
focus	1
is	4
still	3

Only	2
the	6
Federal	1

is	4
likely	2
to	5
be	4
able	2

take	3
a	5
long-run	0

view	2

If	3
only	3
state	2
funds	1
were	4
used	3
to	5
pay	2
for	4
the	6
vocational	2
education	2
,	5
it	4
could	3
be	4
argued	1
that	4
the	6
state	2
should	3
not	4
have	4
to	5
bear	1
the	6
cost	2
of	5
vocational	2

which	4
would	4
benefit	1
employers	0

other	3
states	2

However	2
,	5
if	3
Federal	1
funds	1
are	4
used	3
,	5
it	4
would	4
be	4
entirely	2
appropriate	1
to	5
train	1
workers	1
for	4
jobs	1
which	4
could	3
be	4
obtained	2
elsewhere	1
as	4
well	3
as	4
for	4

the	6
area	2

Such	1

the	6

leave	2
the	6

find	2
jobs	1
in	5
other	3

A	3
further	2
possibility	1
is	4
suggested	2
by	4
the	6
example	2
of	5

G.	1

that	4

financial	1
assistance	1
to	5
individuals	1
for	4

would	4
require	1
some	3
support	2
for	4
subsistence	0
as	4

for	4

the	6

A	3
maximum	2
of	5
$	2
600	0

how	3

From	2
this	4

the	6
conclusion	1
that	4
any	3

The	4

She	3

That	3

one	4

She	3

invited	0
him	4

It	3

Without	1

without	2
giving	1
her	3
a	5
chance	1

prepare	1
for	4
it	4

From	2
behind	2

he	4

put	2
his	4

on	4
her	3
shoulders	1
,	5
turned	2
her	3
around	3

and	5
pressed	1

him	4

so	3

Later	1

she	3

that	4

But	3
he	4

When	3
he	4

she	3
knew	2
she	3

Stanley	0

She	3

that	4

She	3

one	4

this	4
conclusion	1

She	3
thought	3
it	4

sometime	0
during	2
the	6
second	2
week	2
she	3
worked	2
for	4
Stanley	0
.	5

It	3
was	4
nothing	2
that	4
he	4
said	3
or	4
did	3
,	5
but	4
it	4
seemed	2
so	3
natural	2
to	5
her	3
that	4
she	3
should	3
be	4
working	2
for	4
him	4
,	5
looking	2
forward	2
to	5
his	4
eventual	0
proposal	1

She	3

thirty-one	0

Her	2

already	2
considerably	1
concerned	2

For	3

it	4
was	4
only	3
a	5
matter	2

Stanley	0

It	3

Stanley	0

the	6

no	3

As	3
a	5
result	2

he	4
never	3
looked	2
for	4
it	4

But	3
one	4
day	3

she	3
expected	2

he	4

somehow	1

without	2
her	3

that	4
there	3

On	2

Stanley	0

The	4
wastebasket	0
stood	2
near	2
the	6
wall	2
next	2
to	5
the	6
divan	0
,	5
and	5
the	6
instant	1
Casey	0
picked	1
it	4
up	3
he	4
knew	2
what	3
had	4
happened	2
.	5

The	4
discarded	0
papers	1
inside	2
were	4
sodden	0
,	5
there	3
was	4
a	5
glint	0
of	5
liquid	1
at	4
the	6
bottom	1
,	5
and	5
the	6
smell	1
of	5
whisky	1
was	4
strong	2
and	5
distinct	1
.	5

He	4
put	2
the	6
basket	1
down	3
distastefully	0
,	5
muttering	0
softly	1
and	5
thoroughly	1
disgusted	0
with	4
himself	3
and	5
his	4
plan	2
that	4
had	4
seemed	2
so	3
foolproof	0
.	5

For	3
he	4
remembered	1
too	3
well	3
how	3
he	4
had	4
brought	2
back	3
the	6
loaded	1
drinks	0
to	5
Burton	0
and	5
then	3
returned	1
to	5
the	6
kitchen	2
to	5
get	3
weaker	0
drinks	0
for	4
himself	3
.	5

For	3
another	3
second	2
or	4
two	3
he	4
gave	2
in	5
to	5
the	6
annoyance	0
that	4
was	4
directed	1
at	4
himself	3
;	4
then	3
his	4
mind	2
moved	2
on	4
to	5
be	4
confronted	1
by	4
something	2
far	2
more	3
serious	2
,	5
and	5
as	4
the	6
thought	3
expanded	0
,	5
the	6
implications	1
jarred	0
him	4
.	5

It	3
no	3
longer	2
mattered	0
that	4
Burton	0
had	4
outsmarted	0
him	4
.	5

The	4
important	2
thing	2
was	4
that	4
Burton	0
had	4
gone	2
somewhere	1
to	5
meet	2
a	5
blackmailer	0
with	4
a	5
gun	1
in	5
his	4
pocket	1
.	5

And	3
that	4
gun	1
was	4
empty	1
.	5

Even	2
before	3
his	4
mind	2
had	4
rounded	0
out	3
the	6
idea	2
,	5
he	4
thrust	1
one	4
hand	2
into	3
his	4
trousers	0
pocket	1
and	5
pulled	1
out	3
the	6
six	2
slugs	0
he	4
had	4
taken	2
from	4
the	6
revolver	0
.	5

He	4
considered	2
them	3
with	4
brooding	1
eyes	2
,	5
brows	0
bunched	0
as	4
his	4
brain	1
grappled	0
with	4
the	6
problem	2
and	5
tried	2
to	5
find	2
some	3
solution	1
.	5

He	4
said	3
:	3
``	4
The	4
crazy	1
fool	1
''	4
,	5
half	2
aloud	1
.	5

He	4
put	2
the	6
shells	0
on	4
the	6
table	2
,	5
as	4
though	2
he	4
could	3
no	3
longer	2
bear	1
to	5
hold	2
them	3
.	5

He	4
thought	3
:	3
Where	2
the	6
hell	1
could	3
he	4
have	4
gone	2
?	4

How	2
can	3
I	4
find	2
him	4
?	4

There	3
was	4
no	3
answer	2
to	5
this	4
and	5
he	4
began	2
to	5
pace	1
back	3
and	5
forth	1
across	2
the	6
room	2
,	5
his	4
imagination	1
out	3
of	5
control	2
.	5

He	4
tried	2
to	5
tell	2
himself	3
that	4
maybe	1
Burton	0
had	4
sobered	0
up	3
enough	2
to	5
get	3
some	3
sense	2
.	5

Maybe	1
he	4
only	3
intended	1
to	5
scare	0
the	6
blackmailer	0
,	5
whoever	0
he	4
was	4
,	5
in	5
which	4
case	2
an	4
unloaded	0
gun	1
would	4
be	4
good	3
enough	2
.	5

He	4
thought	3
of	5
other	3
possibilities	1
,	5
none	1
of	5
them	3
satisfactory	1
,	5
and	5
finally	2
he	4
began	2
to	5
think	2
,	5
to	5
wonder	1
if	3
there	3
was	4
some	3
way	3
he	4
could	3
reach	2
Burton	0
.	5

Then	2
,	5
as	4
he	4
turned	2
toward	2
the	6
telephone	1
,	5
it	4
rang	1
shrilly	0
to	5
shatter	0
the	6
stillness	0
in	5
the	6
room	2
and	5
he	4
reached	2
for	4
it	4
eagerly	0

``	4

he	4
knew	2
who	3

it	4

him	4
a	5

make	3
the	6
mental	1
readjustment	0

control	2
the	6

inside	2

When	3

still	3
terribly	1

As	3

again	3
he	4

for	4

He	4

it	4

up	3

called	2
the	6
bar	1
and	5
grill	0
where	3
he	4
had	4
picked	1
Burton	0
up	3
that	4
afternoon	2

When	3
he	4
was	4
told	2
that	4
no	3
one	4
had	4
seen	2
Burton	0
since	3
then	3
,	5
he	4
thought	3
of	5
three	3
other	3
places	2
that	4
were	4
possibilities	1

Each	2
time	3
he	4
got	2
the	6

in	5

he	4

all	4

that	4
was	4
that	4

And	3
anyway	1
Burton	0
was	4
not	4
the	6
kind	2
of	5
guy	1
who	3
would	4
be	4
likely	2
to	5
get	3
in	5
trouble	2
even	3
when	3
he	4
was	4
drunk	1

He	4
,	5
Casey	0

had	4
been	4
scared	0
for	4
a	5
while	3

but	4
that	4
had	4
come	3
mostly	1
from	4
the	6
fact	2
that	4
he	4
felt	2

He	4
should	3
have	4
stayed	1
here	3

watched	2

he	4

what	3

kept	2
telling	1
himself	3
this	4

he	4
went	3
out	3
to	5
the	6

make	3

Only	2
then	3
did	3

considered	2

And	3
then	3
again	3
perhaps	2
the	6
reason	2
why	2
he	4
could	3
n't	3
find	2
time	3
to	5
do	3
any	3

because	3
he	4

them	3

There	3
was	4
no	3

them	3

They	3

nobody	1
really	2
gave	2
a	5

During	2
all	4

he	4
had	4
only	3
done	2
things	2

be	4

This	3
habit	0
had	4
become	2
so	3
fixed	2
over	3

it	4
seemed	2

down	3

that	4

someone	1
who	3
knew	2
what	3

Then	2
at	4

something	2
