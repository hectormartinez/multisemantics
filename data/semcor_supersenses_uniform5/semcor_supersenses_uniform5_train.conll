Jerebohm	0
and	4
his	3

Pinkie	0
have	3
reached	1
the	4
stage	1

that	3
stirs	0
a	3
longing	0
for	3
the	4
more	2
atrociously	0
expensive	0
rustic	0
simplicities	0

They	2
want	1
to	3
own	2
a	3
junior-grade	0
castle	0
,	4
or	3
a	3
manor	0
house	2
,	4
or	3
some	2

for	3
Great	1

And	2
of	4

Larkin	0
has	2
just	2
the	4
thing	2
they	2
want	1
.	4

It	2
's	3
a	3
horror	0

That	2
's	3
not	3
precisely	1
the	4
way	2
Larkin	0

them	2

it	3

conjures	0
herds	0

He	2
suggests	0

all	2
the	4
glories	0

The	3

The	3
spaciousness	0

Larkin	0

that	3

In	2

we	2

that	3

that	3

the	4

In	2

the	4

our	2

we	2

We	2

the	4

such	2

exclude	0
more	2
than	2
two	2
,	4
then	2
the	4
question	1
of	4
a	3
``	3
third	1
''	3
possibility	1
is	3
a	3
meaningless	0
question	1

Thus	1
,	4
if	2
what	2
is	3
at	3
issue	1
is	3
whether	1
``	3
All	1

``	3

''	3
,	4
since	2
in	3
either	1
case	1
the	4
judgment	1
in	3
question	1
is	3
false	0

Hence	0
,	4
if	2
what	2
is	3
in	3
question	1
is	3
whether	1
in	3
a	3
given	2
theology	0

for	3

in	3
either	1

the	4

Therefore	1

For	2

wet	1
them	2

Then	2
I	3
cover	1
the	4

a	3

This	2

it	3

They	2
arise	0
in	3

To	1

reiterates	0

statement	1

But	2
a	3
somewhat	1

that	3
the	4
daylight	0

dwindle	0
to	3
complete	1

apparently	1
gave	1
rise	1
to	3
a	3
ritual	0

which	2
we	2

It	2
is	3
curious	0
that	3
even	2
centuries	1
of	4
repetition	0

the	4

did	2
not	3
induce	0
a	3

This	2

This	2

provides	1
a	3
very	2

example	1

the	4
fact	2
that	3
one	2
can	2

Almost	0
equal	1
in	3
size	1
to	3
a	3
honeybee	0

A.	1
armata	0
is	3
much	2
more	2
beautiful	1
in	3
color	1

at	3

in	3

After	1

digs	0
a	3

about	2
the	4
size	1

The	3
bottom	0
part	2
of	4
a	3

a	3
number	2
of	4
side	1
tunnels	0

``	3

The	3
development	1
of	4
the	4
Andrena	0
larvae	0
is	3
very	2
rapid	1

so	2
that	3
by	3
the	4
end	2
of	4
spring	1
they	2
have	3
already	1
pupated	0

But	2
they	2

remain	1
there	2
throughout	1
the	4

Their	1
appearance	1

next	1

coincides	0
in	3
an	2
almost	2
uncanny	0
way	2
with	3
the	4
flowering	0

In	2

We	2

(	2
Actually	0

a	3

f	2

Such	1

obviously	1
the	4
zero	0

for	3

the	4

then	2
since	2
the	4

the	4

hence	0

f	2

Let	1

Then	2

Any	0

be	3

This	2

applied	1

We	2
can	2
now	2
prove	1
several	1
lemmas	0

In	2
some	2
neighborhood	1
in	3
the	4
f-plane	0
of	4
any	2
ordinary	1
point	1
of	4
the	4
graph	0
,	4
the	4
function	1
f	2
is	3
a	3
single	1

,	4
continuous	0
function	1
.	4

We	2
first	2
show	1
that	3
the	4
function	1
is	3
single	1
valued	0
in	3
some	2
neighborhood	1
.	4

With	1
the	4
vertex	0
at	3
**f	2
in	3
the	4
C-plane	0
we	2
assume	1
that	3
**f	2
is	3
the	4
parametric	0
location	1
on	3
C	1
of	4
an	2
ordinary	1
intersection	0
Q	1
between	2
C	1
and	4
**f	2
.	4

In	2
the	4
f-plane	0
the	4
coordinates	0
of	4
the	4
corresponding	1
point	1
are	3
**f	2
.	4

We	2
know	2
that	3
in	3
the	4
C-plane	0
both	2
C	1
and	4
**f	2
are	3
analytic	0
.	4

In	2
the	4
C-plane	0
we	2
construct	0
a	3
set	2
of	4
rectangular	0
Cartesian	0
coordinates	0
u	0
,	4
v	0
with	3
the	4
origin	0
at	3
Q	1
and	4
such	2
that	3
both	2
C	1
and	4
**f	2
have	3
finite	0
slope	0
at	3
Q	1
.	4

Near	0
Q	1
,	4
both	2
curves	0
can	2
be	3
represented	1
by	3
analytic	0
functions	1
of	4
u	0
.	4

In	2
a	3
neighborhood	1
of	4
Q	1
the	4
difference	1
between	2
these	2
functions	1
is	3
also	2
a	3
single	1
valued	0
,	4
analytic	0
function	1
of	4
u	0
.	4

Furthermore	0
,	4
one	2
can	2
find	2
a	3
neighborhood	1
of	4
Q	1
in	3
which	2
the	4
difference	1
function	1
is	3
monotone	0
,	4
for	3
since	2
it	3
is	3
analytic	0
it	3
can	2
have	3
only	2
a	3
finite	0
number	2
of	4
extrema	0
in	3
any	2
interval	0
.	4

Now	1
,	4
to	3
find	2
**f	2
,	4
one	2
needs	1
the	4
intersection	0
of	4
C	1
and	4
**f	2
near	1
Q	1
.	4

But	2
**f	2
is	3
just	2
the	4
curve	1
**f	2
translated	0
without	2
rotation	0
through	2
a	3
small	2
arc	1
,	4
for	3
**f	2
is	3
always	2
obtained	1
by	3
rotating	0
C	1
through	2
exactly	1
90	0
`	1
.	4

The	3
arc	1
is	3
itself	2
a	3
segment	0
of	4
an	2
analytic	0
curve	1
.	4

Thus	1
if	2
e	0
is	3
sufficiently	1
small	2
,	4
there	2
can	2
be	3
only	2
one	2
intersection	0
of	4
C	1
and	4
**f	2
near	1
Q	1
,	4
for	3
if	2
there	2
were	2
more	2
than	2
one	2
intersection	0
for	3
every	2
e	0
then	2
the	4
difference	1
between	2
C	1
and	4
**f	2
near	1
Q	1
would	2
not	3
be	3
a	3
monotone	0
function	1
.	4

Therefore	1
,	4
**f	2
is	3
single	1
valued	0
near	1
Q	1
.	4

It	2
is	3
also	2
seen	1
that	3
**f	2
,	4
since	2
the	4
change	1
from	3
**f	2
to	3
**f	2
is	3
accomplished	0
by	3
a	3
continuous	0
translation	0
.	4

Thus	1
**f	2
is	3
also	2
continuous	0
at	3
**f	2
,	4
and	4
in	3
a	3
neighborhood	1
of	4
**f	2
which	2
does	2
not	3
contain	1
a	3
tangent	1
point	1
.	4

We	2
turn	1
now	2
to	3
the	4
set	2
of	4
tangent	1
points	1
on	3
the	4
graph	0
.	4

This	2
set	2
must	2
consist	0
of	4
isolated	1
points	1
and	4
closed	1
intervals	0
.	4

The	3
fact	2
that	3
there	2
can	2
not	3
be	3
any	2
limit	1
points	1
of	4
the	4
set	2
except	1
in	3
closed	1
intervals	0
follows	1
from	3
the	4
argument	1
used	2
in	3
Lemma	0
1	2
,	4
namely	0
,	4
that	3
near	1
any	2
tangent	1
point	1
in	3
the	4
C-plane	0
the	4
curves	0
C	1
and	4
**f	2
are	3
analytic	0
,	4
and	4
therefore	1
the	4
difference	1
between	2
them	2
must	2
be	3
a	3
monotone	0
function	1
in	3
some	2
neighborhood	1
on	3
either	1
side	1
of	4
the	4
tangent	1

This	2
prevents	0
the	4
occurrence	0
of	4
an	2
infinite	0

of	4

In	2
some	2

of	4
an	2
isolated	1

point	1
in	3
the	4
f-plane	0
,	4
say	2
**f	2
,	4
the	4
function	1
**f	2
is	3
either	1
double	1

at	3

A	2

Q	1
in	3
the	4
C-plane	0
occurs	0
when	2
C	1

A	2

in	3

results	1
in	3
a	3
translation	0
along	1
an	2

of	4
the	4
curve	1
**f	2
.	4

There	2
are	3
three	2
possibilities	0
:	2
(	2
a	3
)	2
**f	2
remains	1
tangent	1
to	3
C	1
as	3
it	3
is	3
translated	0
;	2
(	2
b	1

**f	2
moves	0
away	2
from	3

does	2
not	3
intersect	0
it	3
at	3
all	2
for	3
**f	2

(	2

**f	2

and	4
there	2
are	3
two	2
ordinary	1
intersections	0
for	3
every	2
t	1
in	3
**f	2
.	4

The	3
first	2
possibility	1
results	1
in	3
a	3
closed	1
interval	0
of	4
tangent	1
points	1
in	3
the	4
f-plane	0
,	4
the	4
end	2
points	1
of	4
which	2
fall	1
into	2
category	0
(	2

or	3
(	2

.	4

In	2
the	4
second	1
category	0
the	4
function	1
**f	2
has	2
no	2

defined	1
in	3
a	3

**f	2

In	2
the	4
third	1
category	0
the	4
function	1
is	3
double	1
valued	0
in	3
this	3
interval	0
.	4

The	3
same	2
remarks	1
apply	0
to	3
an	2
interval	0
on	3
the	4
other	2
side	1
of	4
**f	2

Again	0
,	4
the	4
analyticity	0
of	4
the	4
two	2

guarantee	0
that	3
such	2

exist	1

In	2
the	4
neighborhood	1
of	4
an	2
end	2
point	1
of	4
an	2
interval	0
of	4
tangent	1
points	1
in	3

the	4
function	1
is	3
two	2
valued	0
or	3
no	2
valued	0
on	3
one	2
side	1
,	4
and	4
is	3
a	3
single	1

function	1
consisting	0
entirely	1
of	4
tangent	1
points	1
on	3
the	4
other	2
side	1
.	4

With	1
the	4
above	1
results	1
we	2
can	2
make	2
the	4
following	1
remarks	1
about	2
the	4
graph	0
of	4
f	2
.	4

First	1
,	4
for	3
any	2
value	1
of	4
t	1
for	3
which	2
all	2
values	1
of	4
f	2
(	2
t	1
)	2
are	3
ordinary	1
points	1
the	4
number	2
of	4
values	1
of	4
f	2
(	2
t	1
)	2
must	2
be	3
odd	1
.	4

For	2
it	3
is	3
clear	1
that	3
the	4
total	1
number	2
of	4
ordinary	1
intersections	0
of	4
C	1
and	4
**f	2
must	2
be	3
even	2
(	2
otherwise	1
,	4
starting	1
in	3
the	4
interior	1
of	4
C	1
,	4
**f	2
could	2
not	3
finally	1
return	1
to	3
the	4
interior	1
)	2
,	4
and	4
the	4
center	1
of	4
rotation	0
at	3
t	1
is	3
the	4
argument	1
of	4
the	4
function	1
,	4
not	3
a	3
value	1
.	4

Therefore	1
,	4
for	3
any	2
value	1
of	4
t	1
the	4
number	2
of	4
values	1
of	4
f	2
(	2
t	1
)	2
is	3
equal	1
to	3
the	4
(	2
finite	0
)	2
number	2
of	4
tangent	1
points	1
corresponding	1
to	3
the	4
argument	1
t	1
plus	1
an	2
odd	1
number	2
.	4

The	3
number	2
of	4
ordinary	1
values	1
of	4
the	4
function	1
f	2
(	2
t	1
)	2
at	3
t	1
will	2
be	3
called	2
its	2
multiplicity	0
at	3
t	1
.	4

The	3
graph	0
of	4
f	2
has	2
at	3
least	1
one	2
component	0
whose	1
support	1
is	3
the	4
entire	1
interval	0
[	1
0	1
,	4
T	1
]	1
.	4

We	2
suppose	1
not	3
.	4

Then	2
every	2
component	0
of	4
the	4
graph	0
of	4
f	2
must	2
be	3
defined	1
over	2
a	3
bounded	0
sub-interval	0
.	4

Suppose	0
**f	2
is	3
defined	1
in	3
the	4
sub-interval	0
**f	2
.	4

Now	1
**f	2
and	4
**f	2
must	2
both	2
be	3
tangent	1
points	1
on	3
the	4
nth	0
component	0
in	3
the	4
f-plane	0
;	2
otherwise	1
by	3
Lemma	0
1	2
the	4
component	0
would	2
extend	0
beyond	1
these	2
points	1
.	4

Further	0
,	4
we	2
see	2
by	3
Lemma	0
2	2
that	3
the	4
multiplicity	0
of	4
f	2
can	2
only	2
change	1
at	3
a	3
tangent	1
point	1
,	4
and	4
at	3
such	2
a	3
point	1
can	2
only	2
change	1
by	3
an	2
even	2
integer	0
.	4

Thus	1
the	4
multiplicity	0
of	4
**f	2
for	3
a	3
given	2
t	1
must	2
be	3
an	2
even	2
number	2
.	4

This	2
is	3
true	1
of	4
all	2
components	0
which	2
have	3
such	2
a	3
bounded	0
support	1
.	4

But	2
this	3
is	3
a	3
contradiction	0
,	4
for	3
we	2
know	2
that	3
the	4
multiplicity	0
of	4
f	2
(	2
t	1
)	2
is	3
odd	1
for	3
every	2
t	1
.	4

We	2
have	3
shown	1
that	3
the	4
graph	0
of	4
f	2
contains	0
at	3
least	1
one	2
component	0
whose	1
inverse	0
is	3
the	4
entire	1
interval	0
[	1
0	1
,	4
T	1
]	1
,	4
and	4
whose	1
multiplicity	0
is	3
odd	1
.	4

There	2
must	2
be	3
an	2
odd	1
number	2
of	4
such	2
components	0
,	4
which	2
will	2
be	3
called	2
complete	1
components	0
.	4

The	3
remaining	0
(	2
incomplete	0
)	2
components	0
all	2
have	3
an	2
even	2
number	2
of	4
ordinary	1
points	1
at	3
any	2
argument	1
,	4
and	4
are	3
defined	1
only	2
on	3
a	3
proper	1
sub-interval	0
of	4
[	1
0	1
,	4
T	1
]	1
.	4

We	2
must	2
now	2
show	1
that	3
on	3
some	2
component	0
of	4
the	4
graph	0
there	2
exist	1
two	2
points	1
for	3
which	2
the	4
corresponding	1
diagonal	0
points	1
in	3
the	4
C-plane	0
are	3
on	3
opposite	1
sides	1
of	4
C	1
.	4

We	2
again	2
consider	1
a	3
fixed	1
point	1
P	0
at	3
**f	2
and	4
a	3
variable	1
point	1
Q	1
at	3
**f	2

We	2
erect	0
a	3
square	1
with	3
PQ	0

with	3
free	1
corners	0
**f	2

**f	2
adjacent	0

As	2
s	0

from	3

the	4
values	1
of	4
s	0
for	3

**f	2

**f	2
cross	0
C	1
will	2
be	3
denoted	0
by	3

We	2
have	3
**f	2

These	2
s-values	0
are	3
just	2
the	4
ordinary	1

of	4
**f	2

The	3
values	1

**f	2
of	4
a	3

which	2
has	2
components	0

those	2

f	2
(	2

We	2
first	2
define	0
a	3
function	1
b	1
(	2

as	3
follows	1
:	2
given	2
the	4
set	2

such	2
that	3
each	2

three	2
corners	0
on	3
C	1

vertex	0
at	3
t	1

b	1
(	2

is	3
the	4

set	2
of	4
positive	1
parametric	0
differences	1
between	2
t	1

The	3

f	2

b	1
have	3
exactly	1
the	4
same	2
multiplicity	0
at	3
every	2

Now	1
with	3
P	0
fixed	1
at	3
**f	2

**f-values	0
occur	1
when	2
the	4

are	3

the	4

such	2
that	3
**f	2

The	3

the	4

We	2
define	0
these	2

define	0
g	0

Consider	0

On	2

nothing	1

For	2
what	2
I	3
express	0

my	2
remark	0
is	3
something	2
going	2
on	3
in	3
me	2
at	3
the	4
time	2

and	4
that	3
of	4
course	2
did	2
not	3

I	3
did	2
come	2
on	3
the	4
scene	1

The	3
pain	1

the	4
rabbit	0

not	3

Now	1
that	3
this	3

at	3
odds	0
with	3

may	2
be	3

as	3

Let	1
us	2
put	1
to	3
ourselves	0
the	4
hypothesis	0
that	3
we	2
had	3
not	3
come	2
on	3
the	4
scene	1
and	4
that	3
the	4
rabbit	0
never	2
was	3
discovered	1

Are	1
we	2
prepared	1
to	3
say	2
that	3
in	3
that	3

nothing	1

the	4
sense	1

which	2
we	2
said	2
it	3

?	2

Clearly	0
not	3

Indeed	1
we	2
should	2
say	2
,	4
on	3
the	4
contrary	1
,	4
that	3
the	4
accident	0
of	4
our	2
later	1
discovery	0
made	2
no	2
difference	1
whatever	1
to	3
the	4
badness	0
of	4
the	4
animal	1
's	3
pain	1
,	4
that	3
it	3
would	2
have	3
been	2
every	2
whit	0
as	3
bad	1
whether	1
a	3
chance	1

happened	1
later	1

discover	0
the	4
body	2

feel	1
repugnance	0

not	3

If	2
so	2
,	4
then	2
it	3
is	3
clear	1
that	3
in	3
saying	1
the	4
suffering	1
was	3
bad	1
we	2
are	3
not	3
expressing	0
our	2
feelings	1

We	2
are	3

bad	1
when	2

before	2
anyone	1
took	2
an	2
attitude	1

it	3

The	3
first	2
argument	1
is	3
thus	1
an	2
ideal	1
experiment	1
in	3
which	2
we	2
use	2
the	4
method	1
of	4
difference	1
.	4

It	2
removes	0
our	2
present	2
expression	1
and	4
shows	1
that	3
the	4
badness	0
we	2
meant	1
would	2
not	3
be	3
affected	0
by	3
this	3
,	4
whereas	0
on	3
positivist	0
grounds	1
it	3

The	3
second	1
argument	1
applies	0
the	4

the	4
reverse	0
way	2

It	2
ideally	0
removes	0
the	4
past	1
event	1

shows	1
that	3
this	3
would	2
render	0
false	0
what	2
we	2
mean	1
to	3
say	2
,	4
whereas	0
on	3
positivist	0
grounds	1
it	3
should	2
not	3
.	4

Let	1
us	2
suppose	1
that	3
the	4
animal	1
did	2
not	3
in	3
fact	2
fall	1
into	2
the	4
trap	0
and	4
did	2
not	3
suffer	0
at	3
all	2

that	3

mistakenly	0
believe	1
it	3

say	2
as	3
before	2
that	3
its	2
suffering	1
was	3
an	2
evil	1
thing	2
.	4

On	2
the	4
positivist	0
theory	1
,	4
everything	1
I	3
sought	1
to	3
express	0
by	3
calling	0
it	3
evil	1
in	3
the	4
first	2
case	1
is	3
still	2
present	2
in	3
the	4
second	1

In	2
the	4
only	2
sense	1
in	3
which	2
badness	0
is	3
involved	1
at	3
all	2
,	4
whatever	1
was	3
bad	1
in	3
the	4
first	2
case	1
is	3
still	2
present	2
in	3
its	2
entirety	0
,	4
since	2
all	2
that	3
is	3
expressed	1
in	3
either	1
case	1
is	3
a	3
state	1
of	4
feeling	1
,	4
and	4
that	3
feeling	1
is	3
still	2
there	2
.	4

And	2
our	2
question	1
is	3
,	4
is	3
such	2
an	2
implication	0
consistent	0
with	3
what	2
we	2
meant	1

Clearly	0
it	3
is	3
not	3

If	2
anyone	1
asked	2
us	2
,	4
after	2
we	2
made	2
the	4
remark	0
that	3
the	4
suffering	1
was	3
a	3
bad	1
thing	2
,	4
whether	1
we	2
should	2
think	2
it	3
relevant	0
to	3
what	2
we	2
said	2
to	3
learn	1
that	3
the	4
incident	1
had	3
never	2
occurred	1
and	4
no	2
pain	1
had	3
been	2
suffered	1
at	3
all	2
,	4
we	2
should	2
say	2
that	3
it	3
made	2
all	2
the	4
difference	1
in	3
the	4
world	2
,	4
that	3
what	2
we	2
were	2
asserting	0
to	3
be	3
bad	1
was	3
precisely	1
the	4
suffering	1
we	2
thought	2
had	3
occurred	1
back	2
there	2
,	4
that	3
if	2
this	3
had	3
not	3
occurred	1
,	4
there	2
was	3
nothing	1
left	2
to	3
be	3
bad	1
,	4
and	4
that	3
our	2
assertion	0
was	3
in	3
that	3
case	1
mistaken	0
.	4

The	3
suggestion	0
that	3
in	3
saying	1
something	2
evil	1
had	3
occurred	1
we	2
were	2
after	2
all	2
making	1
no	2
mistake	0
,	4
because	2
we	2
had	3
never	2
meant	1
anyhow	0
to	3
say	2
anything	1
about	2
the	4
past	1
suffering	1
,	4
seems	1
to	3
me	2
merely	1
frivolous	0
.	4

If	2
we	2
did	2
not	3
mean	1
to	3
say	2
this	3
,	4
why	1
should	2
we	2
be	3
so	2
relieved	0
on	3
finding	0
that	3
the	4
suffering	1
had	3
not	3
occurred	1
?	2

On	2
the	4
theory	1
before	2
us	2
,	4
such	2
relief	1
would	2
be	3
groundless	0
,	4
for	3
in	3
that	3
suffering	1
itself	2
there	2
was	3
nothing	1
bad	1
at	3
all	2
,	4
and	4
hence	0
in	3
its	2
nonoccurrence	0
there	2
would	2
be	3
nothing	1
to	3
be	3
relieved	0
about	2
.	4

The	3
positivist	0
theory	1
would	2
here	2
distort	0
our	2
meaning	1
beyond	1
recognition	0
.	4

So	1
far	2
as	3
I	3
can	2
see	2
,	4
there	2
is	3
only	2
one	2
way	2
out	2
for	3
the	4
positivist	0
.	4

He	2
holds	0
that	3
goodness	0
and	4
badness	0
lie	1
in	3
feelings	1
of	4
approval	0
or	3
disapproval	0
.	4

And	2
there	2
is	3
a	3
way	2
in	3
which	2
he	3
might	2
hold	1
that	3
badness	0
did	2
in	3
this	3
case	1
precede	0
our	2
own	2
feeling	1
of	4
disapproval	0
without	2
belonging	0
to	3
the	4
pain	1
itself	2
.	4

The	3
pain	1
in	3
itself	2
was	3
neutral	1
;	2
but	2
unfortunately	0
the	4
rabbit	0
,	4
on	3
no	2
grounds	1
at	3
all	2
,	4
took	2
up	2
toward	1
this	3
neutral	1
object	1
an	2
attitude	1
of	4
disapproval	0
and	4
that	3
made	2
it	3
for	3
the	4
first	2
time	2
,	4
and	4
in	3
the	4
only	2
intelligible	0
sense	1
,	4
bad	1
.	4

This	2
way	2
of	4
escape	1
is	3
theoretically	0
possible	2
,	4
but	2
since	2
it	3
has	2
grave	0
difficulties	0
of	4
its	2
own	2
and	4
has	2
not	3
,	4
so	2
far	2
as	3
I	3
know	2
,	4
been	2
urged	0
by	3
positivists	0
,	4
it	3
is	3
perhaps	1
best	1
not	3
to	3
spend	0
time	2
over	2
it	3
.	4

I	3
come	2
now	2
to	3
a	3
third	1
argument	1
,	4
which	2
again	2
is	3
very	2
simple	1
.	4

When	2
we	2
come	2
upon	2
the	4
rabbit	0
and	4
make	2
our	2
remark	0
about	2
its	2
suffering	1
being	2
a	3
bad	1
thing	2
,	4
we	2
presumably	0
make	2
it	3
with	3
some	2
feeling	1
;	2
the	4
positivists	0
are	3
plainly	0
right	2
in	3
saying	1
that	3
such	2
remarks	1
do	2
usually	1
express	0
feeling	1
.	4

But	2
suppose	1
that	3
a	3
week	1
later	1
we	2
revert	0
to	3
the	4
incident	1
in	3
thought	2
and	4
make	2
our	2
statement	1
again	2
.	4

And	2
suppose	1
that	3
the	4
circumstances	1
have	3
now	2
so	2
changed	1
that	3
the	4
feeling	1
with	3
which	2
we	2
made	2
the	4
remark	0
in	3
the	4
first	2
place	2
has	2
faded	0
.	4

The	3
pathetic	0
evidence	1
is	3
no	2
longer	1
before	2
us	2
;	2
and	4
we	2
are	3
now	2
so	2
fatigued	0
in	3
body	2
and	4
mind	1
that	3
feeling	1
is	3
,	4
as	3
we	2
say	2
,	4
quite	1
dead	1
.	4

In	2
these	2
circumstances	1
,	4
since	2
what	2
was	3
expressed	1
by	3
the	4
remark	0
when	2
first	2
made	2
is	3
,	4
on	3
the	4
theory	1
before	2
us	2
,	4

that	3

this	3

whether	1
there	2

that	3

if	2

Most	1

that	3

this	3

at	3
the	4

of	4

the	4

there	2

something	2
very	2
unfitting	0

If	2
we	2
were	2
asked	2
why	1
we	2
thought	2
so	2

we	2
should	2
say	2
that	3
these	2
things	1
involve	0
great	2
evil	1

are	3

and	4
that	3
to	3
take	2

in	3
what	2

plainly	0
unfitting	0

Now	1
on	3
the	4
subjectivist	0
view	1

this	3
answer	1
is	3
ruled	0
out	2

For	2
before	2
someone	1
takes	1
up	2
an	2
attitude	1
toward	1
death	1
,	4
suffering	1
,	4
or	3
their	2
infliction	0
,	4
they	2
have	3
no	2
moral	1
quality	1
at	3
all	2

There	2
is	3
therefore	1
nothing	1
about	2
them	2
to	3
which	2
an	2
attitude	1
of	4
approval	0
or	3
condemnation	0
could	2
be	3
fitting	0

They	2
are	3
in	3
themselves	1
neutral	1

and	4
,	4
so	2
far	2
as	3
they	2
get	2
a	3
moral	1
quality	1
,	4
they	2
get	2
it	3
only	2
through	2
being	2
invested	0
with	3
it	3
by	3
the	4
attitude	1
of	4
the	4
onlooker	0
.	4

But	2
if	2
that	3
is	3
true	1
,	4
why	1
is	3
any	2
attitude	1
more	2
fitting	0
than	2
any	2
other	2
?	2

Would	1

apart	1

there	2

,	4
independently	0
of	4
the	4

nothing	1

In	2
such	2
a	3
case	1

any	2

would	2
be	3
as	3

unfitting	0

which	2
means	1
that	3

Indeed	1
we	2

farther	0

both	2

when	2

precisely	1
because	2

this	3

over	2

Then	2
he	3

With	1
respect	1
to	3
this	3

points	1
are	3
worth	1
making	1

First	1
,	4
it	3

to	3
be	3
based	1
on	3
the	4
fact	2
that	3
on	3
its	2

described	1
as	3
``	3
festivus	0

``	3
gay	1

It	2
overlooks	0
the	4

fact	2

``	3

and	4
the	4
opposite	1
of	4
gay	1

not	3
serious	1

More	1
believed	1
that	3

man	2

That	2
a	3
writer	1

a	3
common	1

mistakenly	0
believe	1
that	3
their	2

what	2
the	4

the	4
audience	1

did	2
not	3
dare	0
at	3
the	4
time	2
to	3
say	2

During	1
the	4
next	1
weeks	1
he	3
looked	2
over	2
the	4
situation	1

First	1
of	4
all	2
there	2
was	3
the	4
parsonage	0
,	4
an	2
utterly	0
impossible	1
place	2
for	3
civilized	0
people	2
to	3
live	1
in	3
,	4
originally	0
poorly	0
conceived	0
,	4
apparently	1
not	3

for	3

with	3
no	2
plumbing	0
or	3
sewage	1
,	4
with	3
rat-holes	0
and	4
rot	0

It	2
was	3
arranged	0
that	3
he	3
would	2
board	1
in	3
the	4
home	2
of	4
one	2
of	4
the	4
old	2
members	1
of	4
the	4
church	1
,	4
a	3
woman	1
named	1
Catt	0
who	2

as	3
Wilson	1
afterward	0
found	2

was	3
briefly	0
referred	0
to	3
as	3

Cat	0
because	2
of	4
her	2
sharp	1
tongue	0
and	4
fierce	0

Ann	0
Catt	0
was	3
a	3

never	2
married	1

to	3
her	2
church	1
,	4
but	2
a	3
perpetual	0
dissenter	0
and	4
born	1

.	4

She	2
soared	0
over	2
the	4
new	2
pastor	0
like	2
an	2
avenging	0
angel	0
lest	0
he	3
stray	0
from	3

Then	2
Wilson	1
looked	2
over	2
the	4
church	1
and	4
studied	1
its	2
condition	1

The	3
salary	0
of	4
the	4
pastor	0
had	3
for	3
years	2
been	2
$	1

and	4
even	2
this	3
was	3
in	3

Wilson	1
made	2
up	2
his	3
mind	1
that	3
he	3
must	2
receive	1
at	3

$	1
2500	0
,	4
but	2
when	2
he	3
mentioned	1
this	3
to	3
the	4
Deacons	0
they	2
said	2
nothing	1

The	3
church	1
itself	2
must	2
be	3
repaired	0
.	4

It	2
was	3
dirty	0
and	4
neglected	0

It	2
really	1
ought	1
to	3
be	3
rebuilt	0
,	4
and	4
he	3
determined	1
to	3
go	2
up	2
and	4
talk	1
to	3
the	4
city	1
banks	0
about	2
this	3
.	4

Meanwhile	0
,	4
the	4
city	1
itself	2

The	3

There	2
was	3

The	3
children	1

nowhere	0

no	2

not	3

The	3

The	3

There	2
were	2

On	2

hotel	1
for	3

which	2
seemed	1
to	3
him	2

Why	1

a	3

down	2

But	2

it	3

there	2

After	1

Wilson	1
discovered	1

across	1

removed	1

a	3

and	4
it	3
occurred	1
to	3
him	2
that	3
the	4
church	1

the	4

Negro	1
homes	1
might	2
gradually	0
be	3

He	2
talked	1
about	2
it	3
to	3
the	4
Presiding	0

The	3
Presiding	0
Elder	0
looked	2
him	2
over	2
rather	1
carefully	1

He	2
was	3
not	3
sure	1
what	2
kind	1
of	4
a	3
man	2
he	3
had	3
in	3
hand	2

But	2
there	2
was	3
one	2
thing	2
that	3
he	3
had	3
to	3
stress	0

and	4
that	3
was	3
that	3
the	4
contribution	0

the	4

and	4
that	3
must	2

looked	2
after	2
immediately	1

In	2
fact	2

he	3
intimated	0
clearly	1
that	3
that	3
was	3
the	4
reason	1

been	2
sent	1
here	2

to	3
make	2
a	3

Wilson	1
stressed	0
the	4
fact	2
that	3
clear	1
as	3
this	3
was	3
,	4
they	2
must	2
have	3
a	3
better	2
church	1

a	3

this	3

out	2
of	4
its	2
rut	0

into	2
a	3
modern	1

He	2
emphasized	0
to	3
the	4
Presiding	0

the	4
plan	1
of	4
giving	1
up	2
the	4
old	2
church	1

moving	1
across	1

The	3
Presiding	0
Elder	0
was	3
sure	1
that	3
that	3
would	2
be	3
impossible	1

But	2
he	3
told	2
Wilson	1
to	3
``	3
go	2
ahead	1

try	1

And	2
Wilson	1
tried	1

It	2
did	2
seem	1
impossible	1

The	3
bank	1
which	2
held	1
the	4
mortgage	0
on	3
the	4
old	2
church	1
declared	0
that	3
the	4

When	2
it	3

the	4

Wilson	1
found	2
that	3
the	4

He	2
was	3

he	3
met	1

The	3

It	2

It	2

It	2
was	3

Wilson	1
again	2
went	2
downtown	1

a	3

an	2
intelligent	0
young	1

who	2
seemed	1

he	3

``	3

The	3

was	3

He	2
came	2
spurring	0
and	4

down	2
the	4

he	3
was	3
bursting	0
at	3

I	3
have	3
observed	1
that	3
being	2
up	2

a	3

changes	1
the	4
whole	1
character	1

As	2
for	3
this	3

I	3
never	2
saw	1
him	2
before	2

never	2

whether	1

I	3
can	2
n't	2

I	3
do	2
know	2
that	3
he	3
gave	1
the	4
day	2
tone	0

distinction	1

The	3
last	2
thing	2
in	3
the	4
world	2
that	3
resembled	0
a	3

was	3
our	2
line	1
of	4

perched	0
on	3
top	1
of	4
a	3
stone	1

and	4
this	3

made	2
us	2

a	3
good	2

sharper	0

more	2
alert	0
to	3
the	4
situation	1

We	2
came	2
down	2
off	2

all	2

I	3
have	3
heard	1
people	2
talk	1

contempt	0
about	2
the	4

but	2
that	3
only	2
proves	0
that	3
a	3

people	2
talk	1

that	3

I	3
put	1

lot	1
more	2
trust	0
in	3
my	2
two	2
legs	1
than	2
in	3
the	4
gun	1

because	2
the	4
most	2
important	2
thing	2
I	3
had	3

about	2

that	3
you	2

The	3

which	2

When	2
they	2
first	2
married	1
he	3
had	3
been	2
working	1
in	3
the	4
fields	1
all	2
day	2
,	4
and	4
she	2
would	2
get	2
in	3
the	4
car	1
and	4
drive	1
to	3
wherever	0
he	3
was	3
working	1
,	4
to	3
take	2
him	2
a	3
fresh	1
hot	1
meal	0
.	4

Now	1
there	2
was	3
no	2
work	2
in	3
the	4
fields	1
,	4
nor	1
would	2
there	2
be	3
till	0
it	3
rained	0
,	4
and	4
she	2
did	2
not	3
know	2
where	2
he	3
went	2
.	4

Not	1
that	3
she	2
complained	0
,	4
or	3
had	3
any	2
cause	1
to	3
.	4

Four	0
or	3
five	1
of	4
the	4
cousins	0
from	3
East	1
Texas	1
were	2
about	2
his	3
age	1
,	4
so	2
naturally	1
they	2
ran	1
around	2
together	1
.	4

There	2
was	3
no	2
reason	1
for	3
her	2
to	3
ask	1
what	2
they	2
did	2
.	4

Thus	1
a	3
new	2
pattern	1
of	4
days	2
began	1
to	3
develop	1
,	4
for	3
Granny	0
Albright	0
did	2
not	3
die	1
.	4

She	2
lay	1
still	2
on	3
the	4
bed	1
,	4
her	2
head	2
hardly	1
denting	0
the	4
pillow	0
;	2
sometimes	1
she	2
opened	1
her	2
eyes	2
and	4
looked	2
around	2
,	4
and	4
sometimes	1
she	2
took	2
a	3
little	2
milk	1
or	3
soup	0
.	4

They	2
stopped	1
expecting	0
her	2
to	3
die	1
the	4
next	1
minute	1
,	4
but	2
only	2
in	3
the	4
next	1
day	2
or	3
two	2
.	4

Those	1
who	2
had	3
driven	0
hundreds	0
of	4
miles	1
for	3
the	4
burial	0
would	2
not	3
go	2
home	2
,	4
for	3
she	2
might	2
die	1
any	2
time	2
;	2
but	2
they	2
might	2
as	3
well	2
unpack	0
their	2
suitcases	0
,	4
for	3
she	2
might	2
linger	0
on	3
.	4

So	1
the	4
pattern	1
was	3
established	1

When	2
Linda	1

put	1
up	2
her	2

she	2

There	2
was	3
not	3
anything	1

everyone	1

and	4
sit	1
on	3

The	3
older	1
men	2
would	2
be	3
there	2
at	3
noon	0

and	4
maybe	0
rest	1
for	3
a	3
time	2
before	2
they	2
took	2

This	2

His	2

even	2

the	4

Another	1

Plus	0
the	4
fact	2

The	3

the	4

It	2

been	2
found	2
comparable	0
with	3

but	2
the	4

degree	1

not	3
find	2

halfway	0

could	2
also	2
add	0
to	3
these	2

that	3

us	2

uses	1

that	3
the	4
main	1

it	3

I	3

First	1

Third	0

the	4
significance	1

that	3
