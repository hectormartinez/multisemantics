On	1
sensing	0
my	3
incredulity	0
to	4
his	2
statement	1
he	3
asserted	0
that	3
Ba'athist	0
cells	0
exist	0
in	3
all	2
parts	1
of	4
the	4
country	1
and	4
that	3
they	3

even	2

formed	0

(	3
often	1
under	1

with	3
their	2
own	2

well	2
as	3
the	4

I	3
concur	0
that	3
Ba'athists	0

immediately	1

But	2
I	3
also	2
see	2
that	3
as	3
a	4
fatal	0
misconception	0

which	2
is	3
doing	2

I	3

believe	1
the	4

anywhere	1

soon	1

Any	1
government	1
that	3
assumes	0
power	1
after	2
the	4

also	2
realises	0
this	3

so	2
not	3
even	2

is	3
going	2

call	2
the	4

despite	0
what	2
he	3

the	4

looking	2
for	3
one	2

more	2
of	4
the	4

My	2
concept	0

that	3
over	2

I	3
would	2
like	2
to	4
own	2
one	2
of	4
all	2
the	4
following	1
artists	0

they	3
are	3
all	2
depending	0
when	2
I	3
find	2
something	2
that	3

like	2

as	3
I	3

if	2
I	3

I	3
like	2
we	3
will	3
purchase	1

I	3
want	2

I	3

some	2
were	2

it	3

re-looking	0
at	3
a	4
Picasso	0

2	2

that	3
your	3

had	2
a	4
couple	1
of	4
years	2

It	2
was	3
a	4
cubist	0
piece	1
from	3

I	3
believe	1
you	3

was	3
about	2
$	2

Is	1
there	2
1	2
available	1

Also	1
I	3
am	2
still	2
thinking	1
about	2
the	4
Matisse	0
we	3
discussed	1
before	2

as	3

I	3
have	3
a	4

I	3

it	3

we	3

With	1
regard	1
to	4

I	3
think	2
that	3
one	2
of	4
the	4
key	1
points	1

are	3
that	3
they	3

With	1
these	2
operating	1

we	3
will	3
know	2

we	3

there	2
is	3
consistency	0

These	1

I	3

The	3
last	2
I	3

after	2
you	3

this	3

I	3
do	3
n't	3
believe	1
that	3
we	3
are	3
quite	1
at	3
the	4
point	1
that	3
we	3

that	3
all	2

the	4

My	2

that	3

that	3

I	3
'm	2
working	1
on	3
it	3
now	2
.	4

Maybe	1
we	3
(	3
Enron	2
)	3
could	2
review	1
it	3
tomorrow	1
morning	1
,	4
then	2
send	1
it	3
to	4
FCE	0
.	4

I	3
can	2
meet	1
around	2
10:00	0
.	4

That	2
way	2
,	4
we	3
can	2
get	2
it	3
to	4
them	2
in	3
time	2
for	3
weekend	1
review	1
.	4

Does	1
that	3
work	2
?	3

Kay	1

It	2
was	3
good	2
to	4
hear	1
from	3
you	3
!	2

We	2
had	2
a	4
nice	1
Thanksgiving	0
here	2
too	2
.	4

It	2
's	3
funny	0
,	4
because	2
usually	1
it	3
's	3
just	2
me	2
,	4
Mom	0
,	4
Craig	0
and	4
Danelia	0
,	4
and	4
Danelia	0
does	2
n't	3
really	2
like	2
roasted	0
turkey	0
or	3
roast	0
beef	0
(	3
not	3
that	3
she	2
would	2
say	2
it	3
to	4
me	2
!	2
)	3
,	4
so	2
there	2
is	3
not	3
just	2
the	4
same	2
joy	0
in	3
cooking	0
it	3
would	2
be	3
elsewise	0
.	4

It	2
was	3
good	2
having	1
the	4
girls	1
down	2
.	4

We	2
played	0
a	4
new	2
version	1
of	4
Uno	0
called	2
"	3
African	0
Uno	0
"	3
that	3
was	3
complex	0
,	4
fast	1
and	4
at	3
times	1
,	4
physically	0
challenging	0
.	4

It	2
's	3
not	3
for	3
the	4
meek	0
.	4

It	2
was	3
incredible	0
what	2
a	4
good	2
player	0
Alena	0
was	3
.	4

She	1
had	2
her	2
cards	0
memorized	0
as	3
well	2
as	3
everyone	1
else	1
s	2
(	3
when	2
you	3
play	1
you	3
'll	2
see	2
why	1
you	3
can	2
know	2
everyone	1
else	1
s	2
hands	1
!	2
)	3
.	4

I	3
expect	1
Craig	0
did	2
n't	3
want	2
Mom	0
to	4
see	2
his	2
place	2
because	2
it	3
was	3
messy	0
.	4

I	3
think	2
compared	0
to	4
my	3
house	1
,	4
he	3
's	3
embarrased	0
about	2
his	2
apartment	1
.	4

Then	1
,	4
also	2
,	4
he	3
's	3
got	2
so	2
much	2
stuff	1
in	3
there	2
right	2
now	2
,	4
that	3
I	3
do	3
n't	3
know	2
how	2
he	3
's	3
going	2
to	4
fit	1
baby	1
stuff	1
.	4

They	2
would	2
only	2
give	2
him	2
a	4
6	1
month	1
lease	0
when	2
he	3
renewed	0
his	2
lease	0
last	2
month	1
because	2
they	3
do	3
n't	3
want	2
3	2
people	2
in	3
that	3
small	1
apartment	1
.	4

So	2
he	3
's	3
going	2
to	4
have	3
to	4
start	1
looking	2
for	3
another	2
place	2
.	4

And	2
his	2
apartment	1
is	3
so	2
run	1
down	2
down	2
I	3
'm	2
afraid	1
roaches	0
might	1
be	3
crawling	0
over	2
the	4
baby	1
.	4

I	3
guess	1
Mom	0
is	3
going	2
to	4
come	2
back	2
down	2
sometime	0
in	3
March	1
or	3
April	1
to	4
see	2
the	4
new	2
baby	1
.	4

You	2
'll	2

Sorry	1
I	3
have	3

written	1
you	3

in	3
a	4
while	2

keep	2
you	3

I	3
am	2
indeed	0
checking	0
on	3
flights	0

and	4
do	3
n't	3
think	2
I	3
'm	2
going	2
to	4
go	2
at	3
exactly	1
the	4
same	2
time	2
as	3
my	3
parents	1
.	4

As	2
much	2
fun	1
as	3
they	3
are	3
,	4
I	3
figured	0
we	3
would	2
probably	1
do	3
some	2
different	1
things	2
than	2
what	2
you	3
have	3
planned	0
for	3
them	2

As	2
for	3
Ted	0
,	4
things	2
are	3
still	2
going	2
well	2
although	1
I	3
have	3
n't	3
see	2
him	2
at	3
all	2
this	3
week	2
(	3
we	3
are	3
two	2
very	2
busy	1
people	2

But	2
,	4
we	3
had	2
a	4
great	2
laid	0
back	2
day	2
last	2
Saturday	1
and	4
I	3
think	2
have	3
hit	1
that	3
comfortable	1
stage	0
...	2
you	3
know	2
,	4
not	3
quite	1
so	2
formal	1
about	2
dates	1
etc	1
.	4

In	2
one	2
sense	1
it	3
's	3
great	2
,	4
but	3
it	3
also	2
makes	1
things	2
a	4
lot	2
harder	0
to	4
read	1
.	4

Anyway	1
,	4
I	3
'm	2
sure	2
my	3
Mom	0

you	3

Travis	0
and	4
Kathy	0
got	2
to	4
meet	1
him	2

I	3

asked	1

to	4
respond	1
to	4
you	3

As	2
you	3
know	2
,	4
the	4
suffix	0
ONLINE	0
is	3
purely	0
descriptive	0
and	4
now	2
used	2
by	3
many	2
companies	1
.	4

Therefore	0
,	4
any	2
trade	1
mark	1
registration	0
that	3
incorporates	0
the	4
word	1
ONLINE	0
as	3
a	4
suffix	0
in	3
the	4
way	2
that	3
you	3
use	2
it	3
will	3
not	3
enable	0
its	2
owner	1
to	4
prevent	0
others	1
from	3
using	1
the	4
word	1
ONLINE	0
.	4

Given	0
the	4
above	1
,	4
if	2
you	3
have	3
adequate	0
protection	0
for	3
the	4

,	4
I	3
'd	1
say	2
that	3
another	2

correct	1
,	4
it	3
looks	1
to	4
me	2
like	2
something	2
needs	1
to	4
be	3
changed	1
.	4

The	3
difficulty	0
lies	1
in	3
the	4
fact	1
that	3
the	4
confirmation	0
system	1
reads	0
the	4
counterparty	0
's	3
name	2
from	3
Global	1
Counterparty	1

Since	1

legal	1

they	3
do	3
not	3
have	3
the	4
power	1

the	4

the	4

it	3
seriously	1

the	4

the	4
correct	1
entering	0

My	2
suggestion	0
is	3
that	3
Global	1

use	2
the	4
same	2
name	2
that	3
the	4
customer	1
has	2
signed	1
on	3
the	4

my	3

returns	0
inappropriate	0
Applications	0
to	4
the	4
customer	1
until	1
they	3
are	3
correctly	0
completed	0
.	4

In	2
this	3
particular	1
case	1
since	2
the	4
counterparty	0
is	3
still	2
not	3
allowed	1
to	4
transact	0

almost	1

these	2
are	3
short	1
term	1

and	4
requiring	0
this	3
documentation	0
will	3
cause	1
us	2
to	4
lose	0
business	2
because	2
competitive	0

do	3
not	3

such	2

the	4
primary	0
reason	1
we	3

is	3
for	3
the	4

a	4

then	2

it	3

in	3
our	2
case	1

they	3

we	3
are	3

up	2

their	2
total	1

therefore	0
they	3

this	3

even	2
if	2
they	3
did	2
,	4
our	2
risk	1
is	3
limited	1
to	4
the	4
premium	0
,	4
not	3
some	2
big	1
payout	0

the	4
risk	1
of	4

the	4

to	4
go	2

a	4

I	3
'd	1
make	2
sure	2
her	2

got	2
on	3
a	4
certain	1
bus	1

The	3
mother	0
was	3
running	1
late	1
for	3
work	2
and	4
could	2
not	3
wait	1

I	3
could	2
n't	3
say	2

...	2
so	2
Nicki	0
(	3
the	4
little	2
girl	1
-	3

and	4
I	3

It	2

now	2
,	4
8:15	0
and	4
there	2
was	3
no	2
sign	1
of	4
her	2

On	1

,	4
I	3
had	2
quiz	0
at	3
8	1

Which	0
I	3
then	2
realized	0
I	3
missed	1

I	3
decided	1
that	3
Nicki	0
would	2
just	2
have	3
to	4
wait	1
on	3
her	2
own	2
.	4

I	3
asked	1
her	2
if	2
she	2
had	2
any	2
relatives	0
that	3
would	2
want	2
to	4
know	2
of	4
her	2

I	3
almost	1
got	2
on	3
without	1
her	2
,	4
but	3
I	3
could	2
n't	3
do	3
it	3
.	4

Finally	0
,	4
I	3
told	2
the	4
little	2
girl	1
that	3
she	2
would	2
have	3
to	4
accompany	0
me	2
to	4
school	1
(	3
8:30	0

)	3

There	2
were	2
only	2
15	1

I	3
stayed	1
for	3

After	1

we	3
went	1
back	2
to	4

within	1

her	2
bus	1

I	3
told	2
the	4

where	2
to	4
drop	0
her	2
off	2

I	3
notified	0
her	2

I	3

the	4

hope	1

Seeing	0
another	2

so	2
why	1

one	2
?	3

I	3
say	2
why	1
not	3
?	3

The	3
main	1
reason	1
is	3
Google	0

accessible	0
to	4
the	4
global	1

rest	1

it	3

not	3

seen	1

suddenly	0
disappear	0
without	1
notice	1
and	4
for	3
no	2
reason	1

Usually	0
this	3
happens	0
because	2
the	4
developer	0

the	4
site	1
can	2
no	2
longer	1
afford	1
the	4
cost	1
of	4
bandwidth	0
being	2
used	2
.	4

That	2
said	2
,	4
the	4
maintenance	0
of	4
this	3
forum	0
is	3
handled	0
by	3
Google	0
and	4
thus	0
will	3
remain	1
reliable	1
and	4
it	3

ultimately	0
give	2
us	2

I	3

the	4

have	3
them	2
use	2
CO2	0
to	4
put	2
the	4
mouse	0

you	3

for	3

the	4

There	2
are	3
some	2
things	2
to	4
consider	1
though	1

Rodents	0
require	1
special	1
bedding	0
in	3
their	2
cages	0
to	4
absorb	0
their	2
waste	1
,	4
and	4
this	3
needs	1

your	3

suffer	0
from	3
problems	1
due	1
the	4
buildup	0
of	4
ammonia	0
from	3
his	2
urine	0

When	2
you	3
take	2
a	4
warm	1

build	1
up	2
steam	0

his	2
cage	1

the	4
urine	0
quite	1
as	3
it	3

You	2
will	3

to	4
be	3
wary	0
of	4
mold	0
forming	0
on	3
any	2
toys	0

aways	0

Overall	0

it	3
is	3

solution	1

but	3
you	3
can	2
keep	2
him	2
healthy	1
and	4
pull	1
it	3
off	2
if	2
you	3
take	2
the	4
time	2
to	4
give	2
him	2
the	4
extra	1
care	1
he	3
will	3
need	2
because	2
of	4
it	3

It	2
may	2
be	3
a	4
problem	1

the	4

I	3
'm	2
unsure	0
of	4
this	3

because	2
once	1
I	3
watched	0

she	2

I	3
heard	1
that	3
a	4
company	1
(	3
here	2
is	3
a	4

that	3

n't	3

As	2
far	1
as	3
I	3
understand	1
,	4
this	3
ad	0
will	3
get	2
dogs	1
excited	0
,	4
but	3
my	3
question	1
is	3
:	2
Can	1
dogs	1
actually	1
see	2
the	4
images	0
featured	0
in	3
the	4
advert	0
like	2
humans	0
?	3

Also	1
,	4
can	2
animals	1
remember	1
images	0
on	3
TV	1
like	2
us	2
,	4
humans	0
?	3

If	2
so	2
,	4
then	2
does	2
that	3
mean	1
that	3
if	2
you	3
watched	0
a	4
scary	0
movie	0
and	4
your	3
dog	1
/	2
cat	1
/	2
parrot	0
was	3
in	3
the	4
same	2
room	1
as	3
you	3
they	3
will	3
also	2
get	2
scared	0
?	3

I	3
would	2
n't	3
know	2
--	2
I	3
do	3
n't	3
particularly	1
like	2
scary	0
movies	0
,	4
and	4
I	3
have	3
n't	3
tried	1
this	3
with	3
my	3
pet	1
.	4

Although	1
,	4
I	3
do	3
n't	3
think	2
that	3
scary	0
movies	0
will	3
affect	0
pets	0
for	3
a	4
long	2
time	2
;	2
I	3
am	2
sure	2
they	3
'll	2
forget	1
sometime	0
--	2
or	3
am	2
I	3
wrong	1
?	3

So	2
what	2
about	2
T.V.	0
?	3

Do	2
dogs	1
enjoy	1
watching	0
T.V.	0
?	3

Well	1
,	4
T.V.	0
is	3
a	4
series	0
of	4
flickering	0
pictures	1
that	3
are	3
streamed	0
together	1
to	4
make	2
a	4
moving	1
picture	0
.	4

The	3
pictures	1
are	3
broadcast	0
at	3
a	4
rate	1
of	4
about	2
60	1
Hz	0
,	4
which	2
is	3
how	2
fast	1
they	3
need	2
to	4
move	1
for	3
us	2
to	4
see	2
them	2
as	3
a	4
moving	1
,	4
flawless	0
picture	0
.	4

To	1
a	4
dog	1
,	4
watching	0
T.V.	0
is	3
a	4
lot	2
like	2
watching	0
and	4
old	2
scratchy	0
silent	0
film	1
because	2
their	2
flicker	0
fusion	0
seems	1
to	4
occur	0
at	3
a	4
rate	1
of	4
70	0
to	4
80	1
Hz	0
.	4

So	2
they	3
see	2
the	4
pictures	1
flicker	0
slower	0
and	4
there	2
for	3
it	3
seems	1
choppy	0
to	4
them	2

So	2
chances	0
are	3
that	3
if	2
your	3
dog	1
likes	0
to	4
watch	1
T.V.	0
,	4
it	3
's	3
probably	1
because	2
of	4
the	4
sounds	0
.	4

Hearing	0
is	3
a	4
dog	1
's	3
secondary	0
sense	1

and	4
I	3
will	3

that	3

Yes	1
they	3
do	3

i	2
m	1
pretty	1
sure	2
that	3
they	3
do	3
see	2
things	2

my	3

How	1
much	2
should	2
I	3
be	3
looking	2
at	3
for	3
horse	1
transportation	0
?	3

I	3
need	2
one	2
horse	1
transported	0
to	4

throughout	0
the	4
2012	0

and	4
the	4
location	1
is	3
about	2
3	2
hours	1
away	1
from	3
where	2
I	3
live	1
.	4

The	3
place	2
where	2
I	3
'm	2
boarding	0
is	3
not	3
likely	1
to	4
want	2
to	4

me	2

and	4
I	3
do	3
not	3
have	3
any	2

him	2

someone	1

If	2
they	3

how	2

I	3
'm	2
willing	1

pay	1
,	4
what	2
is	3
a	4
good	2
price	2

?	3

I	3
saw	1
a	4
site	1
that	3
charges	0
$	2
0.70	0

.	4

Is	1
that	3
reasonable	1
?	3

Impossible	0
to	4
say	2

I	3
guess	1
you	3

the	4

that	3

someone	1

who	2

the	4
time	2

Can	1
rabbits	0
and	4
chickens	0
live	1
together	1
?	3

I	3
am	2
thinking	1
about	2
getting	1
a	4
rabbit	1
as	3
a	4
pet	1
,	4
but	3
my	3
parents	1
said	2
that	3
it	3
has	2
to	4
stay	1
outside	1
.	4

We	2
also	2
own	2
two	2
chickens	0
that	3
are	3
kept	1
in	3
a	4
run	1
behind	1
out	2
garage	0
/	2
barn	0
thing	1
.	4

There	2
is	3
already	2
a	4
little	2
dog	1
house	1
that	3
I	3
would	2
turn	1
into	2
a	4
little	2
rabbit	1
hutch	0
being	2
kept	1
back	2
there	2
and	4
I	3
was	3
thinking	1
about	2
keeping	1
the	4
rabbit	1
in	3
the	4
run	1
with	3
the	4
chickens	0
,	4
but	3
keeping	1
the	4
chickens	0
in	3
the	4
coop	0
and	4
the	4
rabbit	1
in	3
the	4
hutch	0
at	3
night	2
.	4

However	1
,	4
in	3
the	4
day	2
time	2
would	2
it	3
be	3
okay	0
for	3
the	4
rabbit	1
to	4
hop	0
around	2
along	1
with	3
the	4
chickens	0
?	3

We	2
feed	1
the	4
chickens	0
scraps	0
of	4
veggies	0
and	4
fruits	0
throughout	0
the	4
day	2
,	4
but	3
it	3
's	3
nothing	1
that	3
a	4
rabbit	1
would	2
n't	3
be	3
able	1
to	4
digest	0
just	2
fine	1
.	4

So	2
,	4
can	2
rabbits	0
and	4
chickens	0
live	1
together	1
as	3
long	2
as	3
they	3
have	3
separate	1
places	1
for	3
their	2
food	2
and	4
water	1
?	3

(	3
The	3
rabbit	1
hutch	0
would	2
have	3
an	2
opening	1
only	2
big	1
enough	1
for	3
the	4
rabbit	1
,	4
the	4
chickens	0
would	2
not	3
be	3
able	1
to	4
get	2
to	4
the	4
rabbit	1
food	2
)	3
Also	1
,	4
is	3
it	3
okay	0
if	2
the	4
rabbit	1
occasionally	0
sneaks	0
a	4
few	2
bites	0
of	4
chicken	1
feed	1
?	3

My	2
last	2
rabbit	1
did	2
that	3
a	4
few	2
times	1
,	4
and	4
he	3
was	3
fine	1
...	2

I	3
just	2
wan	0
na	0
make	2
sure	2
:)	1
Thank	1
!	2

Yes	1
,	4
but	3
be	3
sure	2
that	3
your	3
chickens	0
are	3
all	2
hens	0
(	3
I	3
mean	1
not	3
roosters	0
)	3
,	4
Roosters	0
may	2
attack	1
rabbits	0
or	3
anything	1
they	3
see	2
moving	1
,	4
so	2
be	3
aware	1
of	4
that	3
,	4
hens	0
are	3
friendly	1
with	3
almost	1
all	2
kinds	0
of	4
pets	0
!	2

From	1
my	3
experience	2
Hens	0
(	3
Not	1
roosters	0
)	3
are	3
very	2
friendly	1
with	3
duck	0
,	4
Guinea	0
pigs	0
,	4
kittens	0
,	4
cows	0
,	4
Rabbits	0
,	4
etc	1
.	4

Be	1
sure	2
not	3
to	4
feed	1
your	3
rabbits	0
non-veg	0
items	1
!	2

You	2
said	2
they	3
live	1
in	3
different	1
cages	0
and	4
they	3
are	3
free	1
in	3
day	2
,	4
so	2
no	2
problem	1
,	4
do	3
n't	3
put	2
both	2
of	4
them	2
in	3
one	2
cage	1
because	2
rabbits	0
bedding	0
is	3
different	1
than	2
that	3
of	4
hens	0
,	4
wet	0
bedding	0
can	2
cause	1
diseases	0
in	3
them	2
!	2

So	2
,	4
do	3
n't	3
put	2
both	2
of	4
them	2
in	3
one	2
cage	1
.	4

Good	1
luck	1
!	2

yea	0
i	2
guess	1
but	3
rabbits	0
a	4
easily	1
escape	1
a	4
pen	0
or	3
another	2
rabbit	1
could	2
get	2
in	3
there	2
and	4
that	3
rabbit	1
could	2
be	3
the	4
opposite	0
gender	1
.	4

So	2
be	3
very	2
careful	0
and	4
some	2
feeds	0
could	2
be	3
toxic	0
to	4
rabbits	0
and	4
safe	1
for	3
chickens	0
.	4

Rabbits	0
do	3
burrow	0
also	2
so	2
do	3
n't	3
be	3
surprised	1
if	2
chicken	1
are	3
falling	0
into	2
holes	0
.	4

rabbits	0
are	3

what	2

'll	2
just	2

Molten	0

usually	1
it	3

Even	1
if	2

you	3

The	3
Guinea	0

Well	1
,	4
I	3
'll	2
try	1

this	3

I	3
have	3
known	1
this	3
guy	1
for	3
a	4
long	2
time	2
,	4
but	3
we	3
've	2
never	2
been	2
good	2
friends	1
or	3
anything	1
.	4

He	2
is	3
my	3
farrier	0
(	3
shoes	0
my	3
horse	1
s	2
feet	1
)	3
so	2
I	3
am	2
technically	0
a	4
client	1
if	2
you	3
want	2
to	4
view	1
it	3
that	3
way	2
.	4

Well	1
,	4
almost	1
two	2
weeks	1
ago	1
he	3
came	1
out	2
and	4
did	2
my	3
horse	1
s	2
feet	1
and	4
was	3
SO	0
flirty	0
.	4

He	2
always	2
hugs	0
me	2
when	2
he	3
comes	1
,	4
but	3
he	3
gave	1
me	2
at	3

5	2
tight	0
,	4
long	2
,	4
back	2

while	2
he	3
was	3
there	2

We	2
were	2
also	2
just	2
talking	1
about	2
my	3
horse	1
's	3
crappy	0
feet	1
and	4
he	3
mentioned	1
.	4

"	3
Well	1
,	4
if	2
you	3
ever	1
just	2
want	2
to	4
see	2
me	2
I	3
'll	2
come	2
out	2

look	2
him	2
over	2

then	2
we	3
can	2
grab	0
a	4
coffee	1
after	2

"	3

That	2
has	2
NEVER	1
happened	1
before	2
so	2
I	3
was	3
kinda	0
realizing	0
at	3
that	3
point	1
that	3
he	3
was	3
a	4
little	2
interested	1
.	4

Right	1
??	1

Anyway	1
,	4
so	2
he	3
ended	1
up	2
leaving	1
one	2
nail	1
out	2
of	4
my	3
horse	1
s	2
foot	1
(	3
I	3
've	2
never	2
heard	1
of	4
a	4
farrier	0
doing	2
this	3
)	3
and	4
telling	1
me	2
to	4
call	2
him	2
in	3
a	4
few	2
days	2
(	3
first	2
it	3
was	3
a	4
week	2
,	4
then	2
it	3
was	3
a	4
few	2
days	2
lol	1
)	3
and	4
he	3
'd	1
come	2
back	2
out	2
and	4
put	2
it	3
in	3
.	4

He	2
told	2
me	2
to	4
remember	1
to	4
call	2
like	2
3	2
times	1
before	2
he	3
left	1
.	4

So	2
,	4
I	3
waited	1
a	4
week	2
to	4
call	2
because	2
I	3
was	3
busy	1
and	4
I	3
wanted	1
to	4
have	3
him	2
come	2
out	2
on	3
a	4
day	2
when	2
I	3
am	2
more	2
available	1
in	3
case	1
we	3
were	2
to	4
hang	0
out	2
after	2
;)	0

Anyway	1
,	4
so	2
that	3
was	3
2	2
days	2
ago	1
that	3
I	3
called	2
and	4
left	1
a	4
message	1
,	4
but	3
he	3
still	2
has	2
n't	3
called	2
back	2
yet	1
.	4

I	3
do	3
n't	3
know	2
if	2
I	3
should	2
call	2
him	2
again	2
tomorrow	1
or	3
not	3
?	3

I	3
know	2
a	4
lot	2
of	4
people	2
say	2
to	4
wait	1
until	1
he	3
calls	1
you	3
,	4
but	3
it	3
's	3
different	1
because	2
I	3
'm	2
a	4
client	1
and	4
technically	0
that	3
's	3
all	2
I	3
am	2
at	3
this	3
point	1
.	4

On	1
the	4
other	2
hand	1
though	1
,	4
if	2
I	3
'm	2
a	4
client	1
he	3
should	2
really	2
of	4
called	2
back	2
by	3
now	2
because	2
you	3
do	3
n't	3
leave	1
a	4
customer	1
hanging	0
.	4

He	2
did	2
n't	3
have	3
my	3
number	2
either	1
because	2
this	3
was	3
the	4
first	2
time	2
I	3
've	2
called	2
HIM	0
instead	1
of	4
his	2
dad	1
.	4

It	2
's	3
a	4
father	1
and	4
son	1
business	2

Anyway	1

I	3
would	2
appreciate	1

because	2
he	3
"	3
did	2
n't	3
want	2
to	4
risk	1
it	3
"	3
with	3
my	3
horse	1
's	3
horrible	1
feet	1
.	4

This	2
is	3
about	2
the	4
fourth	0
time	2
they	3
've	2
done	2
my	3
horse	1
's	3
feet	1
because	2
I	3
just	2
switched	0
back	2
to	4
them	2
.	4

The	3
only	2
reason	1
I	3
switched	0
away	1
from	3
them	2
in	3
the	4
first	2
place	2
is	3
because	2
my	3
good	2
friend	1
who	2
apprenticed	0
with	3
them	2
was	3
starting	1
out	2
on	3
his	2
own	2
.	4

However	1
,	4
he	3
left	1
my	3
horse	1
without	1
a	4
shoe	0
for	3
TWO	0
WEEKS	0
(	3
now	2
that	3
's	3
what	2
I	3
call	2
a	4
crap	0
farrier	0
)	3
.	4

Which	0
,	4
I	3
might	1
add	1
is	3
the	4
same	2
foot	1
that	3
keeps	0
crumbling	0
with	3
the	4
nails	0
.	4

So	2
,	4
obviously	1
I	3
switched	0
back	2
to	4
these	2
guys	1
.	4

Ok	1
,	4
calm	0
down	2
,	4
it	3
's	3
not	3

he	3
's	3
some	2

On	1
the	4

up	2
a	4
super	0
nice	1
6	1
year	2

for	3

He	2

he	3
's	3
been	2
having	1
issues	1

Here	1
's	3
what	2
the	4
owner	1
has	2
said	2
:	2

I	3
have	3
a	4
5	2
year	2
old	2
that	3
lost	1
all	2
of	4
his	2
cheek	0
muscle	0
on	3
the	4
right	2
side	1
about	2
3	2
-	3
4	2
months	1
ago	1
.	4

I	3
chalked	0
it	3
up	2
to	4
possible	1
nerve	0
damage	0
,	4
because	2
this	3
is	3
what	2
the	4
vet	1
thought	1
and	4
the	4
other	2
cheek	0
muscle	0
was	3
fine	1
and	4
he	3
had	2
no	2
theeth	0
problems	1
.	4

So	2
I	3
sent	1
him	2
to	4
the	4
trainers	0
the	4
first	2
of	4
September	1
to	4
be	3
started	1
on	3
the	4
barrels	0
.	4

I	3
got	2
him	2
back	2
the	4
first	2
of	4
the	4
month	1
and	4
he	3
had	2
lost	1
some	2
weight	1
but	3
attributed	0
that	3
to	4
be	3
worked	1
everyday	0
(	3
I	3
expected	1
him	2
to	4
drop	0
some	2
)	3
.	4

He	2
is	3
now	2
losing	0
the	4
cheek	0
muscle	0
on	3
the	4
left	1
side	1
of	4
his	2
face	1
and	4
seems	1
to	4
be	3
dropping	0
weight	1
by	3
the	4
day	2
.	4

Had	0
him	2
to	4
a	4
dentist	0
yesterday	1
and	4
there	2
is	3
no	2
teeth	0
problems	1
.	4

He	2
can	2
eat	1
all	2
his	2
feed	1
and	4
does	2
n't	3
drop	0
any	2
,	4
but	3
can	2
not	3
eat	1
hay	0
from	3
lack	1
of	4
muscle	0
to	4
chew	0
it	3
.	4

He	2
is	3
gant	0
looking	2
in	3
his	2
flank	0
area	1
and	4
is	3
losing	0
topline	0
muscle	0
.	4

The	3
only	2
neurological	0
sign	1
that	3
he	3
shows	1
is	3
that	3
he	3
barely	0
drags	0
his	2
toes	0
and	4
sometimes	1
has	2
trouble	1
with	3
his	2
right	2
lead	1
.	4

The	3
horse	1
I	3
had	2
posted	1
about	2
a	4
couple	1
weeks	1
ago	1
with	3
the	4
atrophied	0
cheek	0
muscles	0
is	3
down	2
to	4
his	2
last	2
resort	0
for	3
life	1
.	4

I	3
CAN	0
NOT	1
afford	1
to	4
treat	1
whatever	1
is	3
wrong	1
with	3
him	2
.	4

NO	1
,	4
I	3
have	3
not	3
done	2
an	2
EPM	1
test	1
but	3
have	3
done	2
an	2
extensive	0
blood	1
panel	0
and	4
my	3
vet	1
did	2
a	4
neurological	0
physical	1
exam	0
.	4

We	2
elected	0
to	4
not	3
do	3
the	4
EPM	1
test	1
because	2
there	2
was	3
NO	1
neurological	0
signs	1
.	4

He	2
is	3
still	2
showing	1
no	2
signs	1
other	2
than	2
the	4
weight	1
loss	0
,	4
and	4
some	2
muscle	0
atrophy	0
.	4

He	2
eats	0
all	2
of	4
his	2
grain	0
but	3
it	3
just	2
takes	1
him	2
a	4
while	2
to	4
get	2
it	3
chewed	0
because	2
of	4
the	4
lack	1
of	4
muscle	0
in	3
his	2
jaws	0
.	4

So	2
I	3
might	1
get	2
the	4
horse	1
and	4
see	2
what	2
I	3
can	2
do	3
.	4

I	3
will	3
be	3
getting	1
with	3
my	3
vet	1
first	2
and	4
if	2
I	3
do	3
get	2
him	2
,	4
have	3
the	4
spinal	0
fluid	0
test	1
done	2
for	3
EPM	1
and	4
a	4
titer	0
test	1
.	4

Will	1
be	3
getting	1
a	4
copy	1
of	4
the	4
blood	1
results	1
the	4
owner	1
has	2
already	2
ran	0
as	3
well	2
.	4

My	2
other	2
theory	1
would	2
be	3
wobblers	0
.	4

I	3
'll	2
be	3
having	1
my	3
equine	0

do	3
some	2
work	2
as	3

if	2
I	3
do	3
get	2
him	2
....	1

Personally	0

any	2
degree	0
...	2
not	3
really	2

what	2
you	3

Even	1
if	2

figure	1
out	2
what	2
is	3
wrong	1

this	3

poneh	0

there	2

the	4

a	4
2	2
-	3
year	2
old	2
certified	0
pre-owned	0
BMW	0
from	3
this	3
dealership	0

The	3
night	2
I	3
drove	0
back	2
home	2
,	4
I	3
found	1
that	3
the	4
rear	0
window	1
has	2
some	2
leakage	0
.	4

(	3
You	2
can	2
hear	1
the	4
wind	0
while	2
driving	1
on	3

.	4

Very	1
likely	1
it	3
needs	1
a	4
new	2
window	1

)	3
.	4

I	3
admit	0
that	3
I	3
should	2
have	3
paid	1
attention	1
to	4
this	3
kind	1
of	4
little	2
things	2
while	2
test	1
drive	1
.	4

(	3
But	2
this	3
is	3
a	4
certified	0
car	2
from	3
a	4
dealer	0
.	4
)	3

So	2
I	3
brought	1
the	4
car	2
back	2
the	4
second	1
day	2
.	4

They	2
told	2
me	2
that	3
this	3
is	3
not	3
under	1
warranty	0
and	4
want	2
to	4
charge	1
me	2
$	2
175	0
just	2
to	4

the	4

Who	1
knows	1
how	2

they	3
want	2
me	2

pay	1

this	3

I	3
walked	1

my	3

still	2

there	2

the	4

at	3

my	3

because	2
we	3

he	3
left	1
the	4

a	4

too	2

the	4

out	2

the	4

He	2
preceded	0

the	4

off	2

he	3
read	1

even	2
though	1

out	2

our	2

Our	1

was	3

quickly	1
in	3

they	3
had	2
their	2
money	2

left	1

Within	0
a	4

we	3

where	2
a	4

had	2
gone	1

We	2
called	2
our	2

assured	0
me	2

would	2
call	2
the	4
office	1
and	4
have	3
it	3
taken	1
care	1
of	4
.	4

We	2
heard	1
nothing	1

We	2
then	2
called	2
the	4
office	1
and	4
the	4
man	1
we	3
spoke	1
to	4
said	2
he	3
'd	1
send	1
someone	1
out	2
to	4
look	2
at	3
it	3
but	3
could	2
n't	3
promise	1
when	2
-	3
two	2
weeks	1
came	1
and	4
went	1
and	4
we	3
heard	1
nothing	1
.	4

I	3
just	2
called	2
again	2
and	4
was	3
told	2
that	3
workmanship	0
,	4
not	3
wood	1
,	4
is	3
guaranteed	0
for	3
a	4
year	2
-	3
well	2
in	3
my	3
opinion	1
-	3
the	4
wood	1
split	0
due	1
to	4
a	4
nail	1
which	2
is	3
part	1
of	4
workmanship	0
!	2

She	1
even	2
went	1
so	2
far	1
as	3
to	4
say	2
"	3
You	2
r	1

about	2
one	2
board	1

Well	1
-	3
when	2
you	3
pay	1
over	2
$	2
1000	0

something	2
you	3

it	3
to	4
hold	1
up	2

I	3
WAS	0
calling	1
about	2
one	2

I	3
'm	2
very	2
frustrated	0
at	3
this	3
point	1

it	3
would	2
take	2
all	2
of	4
10	2
min	0
for	3
them	2
to	4
come	2
by	3
and	4
replace	1
the	4
one	2
board	1
that	3
is	3
cracked	0
(	3
the	4
crack	0
is	3
deep	1
enough	1
to	4
stick	0
a	4

in	3
it	3

it	3
goes	1
clear	1

they	3

After	1

Sear's	0
Automotives	0
in	3
the	4
past	1
,	4
I	3
was	3
shocked	0
at	3
the	4
horrible	1
service	2
received	1
at	3
their	2
Greensboro	0
location	1

I	3
brought	1
my	3
car	2
in	3
on	3
a	4
Sunday	1
to	4
replace	1
a	4
shredded	0
tire	1
.	4

I	3
waited	1
about	2
20	1
minutes	1
in	3
the	4
store	1
part	1
before	2
anyone	2
was	3
able	1
to	4
assist	0
me	2
and	4
was	3
then	2
told	2
to	4
pull	1
my	3
car	2
into	2
the	4
shop	1
(	3
that	3
is	3
apparently	0
what	2
you	3
are	3
supposed	1
to	4
do	3

but	3
the	4
big	1
signs	1

you	3

up	2
that	3
all	2

Once	1
inside	1
,	4
I	3
had	2
to	4
stand	1
around	2
for	3
at	3
least	1
10	2
more	2
minutes	1
before	2
--	2
FINALLY	0
--	2
a	4
technician	0
got	2
to	4
me	2
.	4

Once	1
I	3
returned	1
to	4
pick	1
up	2
my	3
car	2
,	4
you	3
can	2
believe	1
I	3
spent	1
quite	1
a	4
bit	1
MORE	0
time	2
standing	0
around	2
waiting	1
.	4

I	3
had	2
wanted	1
to	4
split	0
the	4
total	1
between	2
a	4
credit	1
card	1
and	4
check	1
card	1
since	2
I	3
was	3
being	2
reimbursed	0
for	3
the	4
tire	1
but	3
was	3
told	2
this	3
was	3
n't	3
possible	1
.	4

Once	1
I	3
actually	1
got	2
back	2
in	3
my	3
car	2
,	4
it	3
was	3
dirty	0
and	4
had	2
grease	0
all	2
over	2
the	4
steering	0
wheel	1

OK	1
,	4
one	2
bad	1
experience	2
...	2
fine	1

The	3
following	1
Friday	1
,	4
I	3
returned	1
with	3
my	3
car	2
to	4
go	2
ahead	1
and	4
replace	1
the	4
other	2
3	2
tires	0
,	4
which	2
were	2
worn	0
.	4

I	3
would	2
not	3
have	3
gone	1
back	2
,	4
but	3
I	3
could	2
n't	3
find	2
the	4
particular	1
tire	1
they	3
'd	1
used	2
in	3
stock	1
anywhere	1
else	1
.	4

Once	1
again	2
,	4
I	3
waited	1
for	3
quite	1
a	4
bit	1
before	2
being	2
attended	0
to	4
.	4

I	3
got	2
the	4
order	1
completed	0
,	4
and	4
then	2
questioned	0
the	4
technician	0
since	2
it	3
came	1
out	2
about	2
$	2
40	0
less	1
than	2
I	3
expected	1
.	4

He	2
said	2
it	3
was	3
the	4
same	2
tire	1
,	4
and	4
verified	0
this	3
,	4
after	2
checking	0
both	2
the	4
actual	0
tire	1
on	3
my	3
car	2
and	4
my	3
service	2
papers	0
from	3
earlier	1
in	3
the	4
week	2
.	4

However	1
,	4
when	2
he	3
printed	0
out	2
the	4
service	2
quote	1
,	4
I	3
could	2
see	2
that	3
it	3
was	3
NOT	1
the	4
correct	1
tire	1
,	4
and	4
was	3
not	3
even	2
an	2
appropriate	0
tire	1
for	3
my	3
car	2
model	1
.	4

So	2
I	3
pointed	0
this	3
out	2
to	4
him	2
,	4
at	3
which	2
point	1
he	3
said	2
they	3
only	2
had	2
one	2
of	4
the	4
correct	1
tires	0
in	3
stock	1
.	4

Ok	1
--	2
fine	1
.	4

So	2
I	3
got	2
just	2
my	3
other	2
rear	0
tire	1
replaced	0
.	4

They	2
promised	0
it	3
'd	1
be	3
done	2
within	1
an	2
hour	1
,	4
so	2
I	3
waited	1
in	3
the	4
lobby	0
.	4

Over	0
two	2
hours	1
later	1
(	3
and	4
ten	0
minutes	1
before	2
they	3
closed	0
)	3
my	3
car	2
was	3
finally	1
finished	1
.	4

A	2
few	2
minutes	1
after	2
I	3
left	1
,	4
I	3
was	3
called	2
and	4
informed	1
that	3
"	3
I	3
"	3
left	1
my	3
wheel	1
lock	0
(	3
which	2
they	3
should	2
have	3
left	1
in	3
the	4
car	2
)	3
.	4

Of	1
course	1
,	4
they	3
would	2
be	3
closing	0
in	3
5	2
minutes	1
,	4
so	2
I	3
would	2
have	3
to	4
hurry	0
up	2
or	3
get	2
it	3
the	4
next	2
day	2
.	4

Of	1
course	1
I	3
could	2
n't	3
make	2
it	3
back	2
in	3
time	2
(	3
and	4
they	3
apparently	0
could	2
not	3
stay	1
5	2
extra	1
minutes	1
to	4
wait	1
for	3
me	2
)	3
.	4

The	3
next	2
day	2
,	4
no	2
one	2
could	2
find	2
my	3
wheel	1
lock	0
and	4
that	3
particular	1
technician	0
was	3
not	3
in	3
.	4

Of	1
course	1
,	4
they	3
could	2
n't	3
call	2
him	2
either	1
to	4
ask	1
about	2
it	3
because	2
apparently	0
they	3
do	3
n't	3
keep	2
their	2
employees	1
'	2
phone	1
numbers	1
(	3
riiight	0
)	3
,	4
so	2
I	3
would	2
have	3
to	4
return	1
on	3
Monday	1
(	3
driving	1
for	3
3	2
days	2
now	2
with	3
no	2
wheel	1
lock	0
should	2
I	3
get	2
a	4
flat	0
)	3
.	4

On	1
Monday	1
I	3
called	2
and	4
again	2
it	3
was	3
a	4
big	1
to	4
-	3
do	3
to	4
find	2
anyone	2
who	2
knew	1
anything	1
about	2
it	3

Supposedly	0
they	3
will	3
be	3
holding	0
it	3
for	3
me	2
this	3
evening	1
,	4
but	3
I	3
'm	2
sure	2
that	3
will	3
also	2
be	3
a	4
huge	1
ordeal	0
.	4

The	3
employees	1
at	3
this	3
Sear's	0
are	3
completely	1
apathetic	0
and	4
there	2
did	2
n't	3
seem	1
to	4
be	3
any	2
sort	1
of	4
management	1
that	3
I	3
could	2

I	3
will	3
never	2

and	4
now	2

some	2
