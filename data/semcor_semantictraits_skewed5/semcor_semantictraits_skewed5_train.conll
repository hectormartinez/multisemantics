Some	2
time	3
ago	2

however	2

Mr.	2
Khrushchev	1
decided	2
that	4
when	3
bigger	1
bombs	1
were	4
made	3

the	6
Soviet	2
Union	2
would	4
make	3
them	3

few	3

50	2

megaton	1

So	2
be	4
it	4
-	4
then	3
we	3
must	3
embark	0
on	4
a	5

So	2
escalation	1
proceeds	1

Jerebohm	0

the	6
more	3

They	3
want	2

just	3
the	6

they	4

That	3

The	4

There	3

an	4
ancient	1

tradition	2
in	5

which	4
derives	0

from	4
the	6
heritage	1

than	3
from	4
the	6
Bible	1

that	4
God	2
is	4
completely	2

creation	1

has	3
no	3
need	2
of	5

his	4
work	3
in	5
the	6
world	3

by	4
analogy	1

the	6

also	3
has	3
been	4
regarded	1
as	4
entirely	2
independent	2

the	6
``	4

the	6
sense	2

requiring	0
nothing	2

be	4
the	6
church	2

But	3
,	5
as	4
Scripture	0
everywhere	1
reminds	0
us	3

God	2
does	3
have	4
need	2

his	4
creatures	1

the	6

a	5
fortiori	0

can	3
ill	1

without	2
the	6
talents	1

which	4
the	6

by	4
God	2

providence	0

presents	1
it	4

And	3
yet	2
this	4
is	4
exactly	2
the	6
risk	1
we	3
run	2
when	3
we	3
assume	1
,	5
as	4
we	3
too	3
often	2

that	4
we	3
can	3
continue	2
to	5
preach	0
the	6
gospel	1

a	5
form	2
that	4
makes	2
it	4
seem	2
incredible	1
and	5
irrelevant	1
to	5
cultured	0
men	3

Until	1
we	3
translate	0
this	4
gospel	1
into	3
a	5
language	1
that	4
enlightened	0
men	3
today	2
can	3
understand	2
,	5
we	3
are	4
depriving	0
ourselves	1
of	5
the	6
very	3
resources	1
on	4
which	4
the	6
continued	2
success	2
of	5
our	3
witness	1
most	3
certainly	2
depends	1
.	5

In	3
arguing	0
in	5
this	4
way	3
,	5
we	3
are	4
obviously	1
taking	2
for	4
granted	1
that	4
a	5
demythologized	0
restatement	0
of	5
the	6
kerygma	0
can	3
be	4
achieved	1
;	4
and	5
that	4
we	3
firmly	1
believe	2
this	4
will	3
presently	1
become	2
evident	1
when	3
we	3
set	2
forth	1
reasons	1
to	5
justify	0
such	3
a	5
conviction	1

But	3
the	6
main	2
point	2
here	3
is	4
that	4
even	3
if	3
such	3
a	5
restatement	0
were	4
not	4
possible	2
,	5
the	6
demand	2
to	5
demythologize	0
the	6
kerygma	0
would	4
still	3
be	4
unavoidable	1
.	5

This	3
is	4
what	3
we	3
mean	2
when	3
we	3
say	3
this	4
demand	2
must	3
be	4
accepted	2
without	2
condition	2
.	5

If	3
to	5
be	4
a	5
Christian	2
means	2
to	5
say	3
yes	1
where	3
I	4
otherwise	1
say	3
no	3
,	5
or	4
where	3
I	4
do	3
not	4
have	4
the	6
right	3
to	5
say	3
anything	2
at	4
all	4

then	3
my	3
only	3
choice	1
is	4
to	5
refuse	1
to	5
be	4
a	5
Christian	2

Expressed	0

if	3
the	6

This	3

To	2
say	3
this	4
,	5
of	5
course	2

is	4
to	5
take	3
up	3
a	5
position	2
on	4
one	4

going	2

at	4

the	6
distinctively	0

period	2

We	3
have	4
aligned	0
ourselves	1
with	4
that	4
``	4
liberal	1

tradition	2

counts	1

half	2
of	5

theology	1
also	3
belong	1

we	3

Finally	1

we	3

also	3
mention	1
the	6

that	4
developed	2

What	3
makes	2
this	4
long	3
and	5
diverse	1
tradition	2
essentially	1
one	4
is	4
that	4
those	3
who	3
have	4
belonged	1
to	5
it	4
have	4
been	4
profoundly	0
in	5
earnest	0
about	3
being	3
modern	2
men	3
in	5
a	5
distinctively	0
modern	2
world	3

Although	2
they	4
have	4
also	3

concerned	2

stand	2
squarely	0
within	2
the	6
tradition	2

apostolic	0

they	4
have	4
exhibited	1
no	3
willingness	0
whatever	1
to	5
sacrifice	1
their	4
modernity	1

Christianity	1

They	3
have	4
insisted	1

rather	2

on	4
living	2
fully	1
and	5
completely	2
within	2
modern	2
culture	1
and	5
,	5
so	3
far	2
from	4
considering	1
this	4
treason	0
to	5
God	2
,	5
have	4
looked	2
upon	2
it	4
as	4
the	6
only	3
way	3
they	4
could	3
be	4
faithful	1
to	5
him	4

When	3
we	3
say	3
,	5
then	3
,	5
that	4
today	2
,	5
in	5
our	3
situation	2
,	5
the	6
demand	2
for	4
demythologization	1
must	3
be	4
accepted	2
without	2
condition	2
,	5
we	3
are	4
simply	2
saying	2
that	4
at	4
least	2
this	4
much	3
of	5
the	6
liberal	1
tradition	2
is	4
an	4
enduring	0
achievement	1

However	2
much	3
we	3
may	3
have	4
to	5
criticize	0
liberal	1

constructive	1
formulations	1

the	6
theology	1

only	3
go	3
beyond	2
liberalism	0
,	5
not	4
behind	2
it	4

In	3
affirming	0
this	4
we	3
have	4
already	2
taken	2
the	6
decisive	1
step	2
in	5
breaking	1
the	6
deadlock	0
into	3
which	4
Bultmann	1
's	4
attempt	1
to	5
formulate	0
such	3
a	5
theology	1
has	3
led	2

If	3
the	6

so	3

invalidated	0
on	4
the	6
material	2
grounds	1
we	3
have	4

provided	1
the	6
possibilities	1
have	4
been	4
exhausted	0
,	5
that	4

in	5
much	3
that	4

significant	1
in	5
American	3

English	2
theology	1

In	3
order	2
to	5
make	3
the	6
implications	1
of	5
our	3
position	2
as	4
clear	2
as	4
possible	2
,	5
we	3
may	3
develop	1
this	4
argument	2
at	4
greater	2
length	2
.	5

We	3
may	3
show	2
,	5
first	3

that	4
there	3

the	6
three	3
typically	0
represented	1
by	4

To	2
do	3
this	4
,	5
it	4
is	4
sufficient	1
to	5
point	2
out	3
that	4
if	3
the	6
principle	1
in	5
terms	2
of	5
which	4
alternatives	0
are	4
to	5
be	4
conceived	1
is	4
such	3
as	4
to	5
exclude	0
more	3
than	3
two	3
,	5
then	3
the	6
question	2
of	5
a	5
``	4
third	2
''	4
possibility	1
is	4
a	5
meaningless	0
question	2
.	5

Thus	2
,	5
if	3
what	3
is	4
at	4
issue	1
is	4
whether	2
``	4
All	2
S	0
is	4
P	1
''	4
,	5
it	4
is	4
indifferent	1
whether	2
``	4
Some	2
S	0
is	4
not	4
P	1
''	4
or	4
``	4
No	2
S	0
is	4
P	1
''	4
,	5
since	3
in	5
either	2
case	2
the	6
judgment	1
in	5
question	2
is	4
false	1
.	5

Hence	1
,	5
if	3
what	3
is	4
in	5
question	2
is	4
whether	2
in	5
a	5
given	2
theology	1
myth	1
is	4
or	4
is	4
not	4
completely	2
rejected	1
,	5
it	4
is	4
unimportant	0
whether	2
only	3
a	5
little	3
bit	2
of	5
myth	1
or	4
a	5
considerable	1
quantity	1
is	4
accepted	2
;	4
for	4
,	5
in	5
either	2
event	2
,	5
the	6
first	3
possibility	1
is	4
excluded	0
.	5

Therefore	1
,	5
the	6
only	3
conceivable	0
alternatives	0
are	4
those	3
represented	1
,	5
on	4
the	6
one	4
hand	2

by	4
the	6
two	3
at	4

apparently	2
self-consistent	0

on	4
the	6

by	4
the	6

A	3

the	6

Recent	0

makes	2
it	4
evident	1
that	4
he	4
does	3
not	4
consistently	1
maintain	1
this	4
distinction	1

He	4
does	3
not	4
mean	2

Adam	2
lost	2

similitude	1

God	2

his	4

mortal	0

capable	1

This	3
idea	2

which	4
occurs	1
in	5
both	3
Tatian	0

Cyprian	0

fits	0
especially	2
well	3
into	3
the	6
scheme	0

Irenaeus	1

theology	1

it	4

the	6
way	3

the	6
passage	1
from	4
life	3
through	3
death	2

life	3
that	4
is	4
achieved	1
in	5
Christ	2

As	3
man	3
can	3
live	2
only	3
by	4
dying	1

so	3
it	4
was	4
only	3
by	4
his	4
dying	1
that	4
Christ	2
could	3
bring	2
many	3
to	5
life	3

It	3
is	4
probably	2
fair	1
to	5
say	3
that	4
the	6
idea	2
of	5
death	2
is	4
more	3
profound	1
in	5
Irenaeus	1
than	3
the	6
idea	2
of	5
sin	1
is	4
.	5

This	3
applies	1
to	5
his	4
picture	2
of	5
Adam	2
.	5

It	3
is	4
borne	0
out	3
also	3
by	4
the	6
absence	2
of	5
any	3
developed	2
theory	2
about	3
how	3
sin	1
passes	1
from	4
one	4
generation	1
to	5
the	6
next	2
.	5

It	3
becomes	2
most	3
evident	1
in	5
his	4
description	1
of	5
Christ	2
as	4
the	6
second	2
Adam	2
,	5
who	3
does	3
indeed	2
come	3
to	5
destroy	1
sin	1
,	5
but	4
whose	2
work	3
culminates	0
in	5
the	6
achievement	1
of	5
immortality	1

This	3
emphasis	1
upon	2
death	2
rather	2
than	3
sin	1
as	4
man	3
's	4
fundamental	1
problem	2
Irenaeus	1
shares	0
with	4
many	3
early	2
theologians	0
,	5
especially	2
the	6
Greek	1
speaking	1
ones	2
.	5

They	3
speak	2
of	5
the	6
work	3
of	5
Christ	2
as	4
the	6
bestowal	0
of	5
incorruptibility	0
,	5
which	4
can	3
mean	2
(	3
though	2
it	4
does	3
not	4
have	4
to	5
mean	2
)	3
deliverance	0
from	4
time	3
and	5
history	2
.	5

Death	1
reminds	0
man	3
of	5
his	4
sin	1
,	5
but	4
it	4
reminds	0
him	4
also	3
of	5
his	4
transience	0
.	5

It	3
represents	1
a	5
punishment	1
that	4
he	4
knows	2
he	4
deserves	1
,	5
but	4
it	4
also	3
symbolizes	0
most	3
dramatically	1
that	4
he	4
lives	1
his	4
life	3
within	2
the	6
process	2
of	5
time	3
.	5

These	2
two	3
aspects	1
of	5
death	2
cannot	2
be	4
successfully	1
separated	1
,	5
but	4
they	4
dare	1
not	4
be	4
confused	1
or	4
identified	1
.	5

The	4
repeated	1
efforts	1
in	5
Christian	2
history	2
to	5
describe	1
death	2
as	4
altogether	1
the	6
consequence	1
of	5
human	2
sin	1
show	2
that	4
these	3
two	3
aspects	1
of	5
death	2
cannot	2
be	4
separated	1
.	5

Such	1
efforts	1
almost	2
always	2
find	2
themselves	2
compelled	1
to	5
ask	2
whether	2
Adam	2
was	4
created	2
capable	1
of	5
growing	2
old	3
and	5
then	3
older	2
and	5
then	3
still	3
older	2
,	5
in	5
short	2
,	5
whether	2
Adam	2
's	4
life	3
was	4
intended	1
to	5
be	4
part	3
of	5
the	6
process	2
of	5
time	3

If	3
it	4
was	4
,	5
then	3
it	4
must	3
have	4
been	4
God	2

intention	1

that	4

The	4
most	3

South	2

are	4

those	3
great	3
velvety	0
flowers	2
were	4
healthy	1
and	5
perky	0
in	5
the	6
glaring	0

I	4
sought	1
out	3
the	6
gardener	0

asked	2
him	4
what	3
he	4
did	3
to	5
produce	1
such	3
beauties	0
in	5
that	4
weather	1
.	5

He	4
seemed	2
puzzled	1
by	4
my	3
question	2
.	5

``	4
I	4
just	3
love	2
them	3
''	4
,	5
he	4
said	3
.	5

The	4
more	3
I	4
talked	1
with	4
him	4
,	5
the	6
more	3
convinced	1
I	4
became	2
that	4
that	4
was	4
the	6
secret	1
of	5
their	4
riotous	0
blooming	1
.	5

Of	2
course	2
his	4
love	2
was	4
expressed	1
in	5
intelligent	1
care	2

He	4
planted	1
the	6
pansy	1
seeds	1
himself	3
,	5
buying	1
them	3
from	4
a	5
pansy	1
specialist	1
.	5

These	2
specialists	1
,	5
I	4
learned	2
,	5
have	4
done	2
a	5
great	3
deal	2
of	5
work	3
to	5
improve	1
the	6
size	2
and	5
health	1
of	5
the	6
plants	2
and	5
the	6
resulting	1
flowers	2

Their	1

vigorous	1

plants	2
half	2
again	3
the	6
size	2
of	5
the	6
unimproved	0
strains	1
.	5

I	4
asked	2
him	4
if	3
he	4
took	2
seeds	1
from	4
his	4
own	3
plants	2
.	5

Occasionally	1
,	5
when	3
he	4
had	4
an	4
unusual	1
flower	1
that	4
he	4
wanted	2
more	3
of	5
he	4
did	3
;	4
but	4
pansy	1
seeds	1
,	5
he	4
told	2
me	3
,	5
soon	2
``	4
run	2
down	3
''	4
.	5

It	3
's	4
best	2
to	5
buy	2
them	3
fresh	1
from	4
a	5
dealer	1
who	3
is	4
working	2
to	5
improve	1
them	3

His	3
soil	1
was	4
``	4
nothing	2
special	2
''	4
,	5
just	3
prairie	0
land	2
,	5
but	4
he	4
had	4
harrowed	0
in	5
compost	0
until	2
it	4
was	4
loose	1
,	5
spongy	0
and	5
brown	1
black	2

I	4
fingered	0
it	4
and	5
had	4
the	6
feeling	2

adequacy	0
that	4
comes	2
with	4
the	6
right	3
texture	1

tilth	0
and	5

It	3
is	4
n't	3
easy	2
to	5
describe	1
it	4

but	4
every	3
gardener	0
knows	2
it	4
when	3
his	4
fingers	1
touch	2
such	3
soil	1

Nothing	1
is	4
easier	1
to	5
grow	2
from	4
seed	1
than	3
pansies	1

They	3
germinate	0
quickly	1

the	6
tiny	1
plants	2
appearing	1
in	5
a	5
week	2

and	5
grow	2

It	3
does	3
n't	3
really	2
matter	2
which	4
month	2
of	5
the	6
year	2
you	4
sow	0
them	3

they	4
germinate	0

when	3
they	4
have	4
a	5
wide	2
variation	2

very	3
warm	1

I	4
like	3
to	5
make	3
a	5
seedbed	0
right	3
in	5
the	6
open	2

though	2
many	3
people	3
start	2
them	3
successfully	1

Pansies	0
do	3
n't	3
have	4
to	5
be	4
coddled	0

they	4

have	4
things	2
rugged	0
,	5
with	4
only	3
moderate	1
protection	1
on	4
the	6

days	2

If	3
you	4
do	3
use	3
a	5
cold	2
frame	1
be	4
sure	2
that	4
its	3
ventilation	0
is	4
adequate	1

For	3
my	3
seedbed	0
I	4
use	3
good	3
garden	1
soil	1
with	4
a	5
little	3
sand	1
added	2
to	5
encourage	1
rooting	0
.	5

I	4
dig	0
it	4

rake	0
it	4
smooth	1

sow	0
the	6
seeds	1
and	5
wet	1
them	3
down	3
with	4
a	5
fog	1
spray	0
.	5

Then	2
I	4
cover	1
the	6
sowing	0
with	4
a	5
board	1
.	5

This	3
keeps	1
it	4
cool	1
and	5
moist	1

protects	0
it	4
from	4
birds	1

Ants	0
carry	2
away	3
the	6
seeds	1
so	3
better	2
be	4

that	4

When	3
the	6
first	3

I	4
remove	1
the	6
board	1

A	3
light	2

Go	1

it	4

But	3
you	4
will	3
never	3
get	3
better	2
flowers	2

the	6

grow	2

Many	2

The	4
easiest	0
way	3
to	5
describe	1
this	4
release	1
is	4
to	5
say	3
that	4
it	4
reproduces	0

The	4
effect	2
of	5

very	3
open	2

natural	2

with	4
the	6

it	4

factor	1
is	4
the	6
perspective	1

the	6

you	4

the	6

near	2
at	4
hand	2

and	5
the	6

the	6

For	3

more	3

of	5

The	4
Presto	0

of	5
the	6

however	2

the	6
thing	2
about	3
this	4

that	4
is	4
most	3
striking	1

the	6
way	3
it	4
sings	0

the	6

which	4
must	3
dominate	0
in	5
this	4

One	2
technical	2
question	2
of	5
school	2
organization	1
comes	2
to	5
mind	2
here	3
.	5

For	3
proper	1
accreditation	1
of	5
schools	2
,	5
teachers	1
in	5
any	3
course	2
must	3
have	4
a	5
degree	2
at	4
least	2
one	4
level	2
above	2
that	4
for	4
which	4
the	6
student	2
is	4
a	5
candidate	1
.	5

Since	2
there	3
are	4
almost	2
no	3
schools	2
in	5
the	6
country	2
offering	1
graduate	1
work	3
in	5
interior	2
design	2
this	4
rule	1
cannot	2
at	4
present	2
be	4
observed	2
.	5

Indeed	1
,	5
it	4
has	3
only	3
been	4
a	5
matter	2
of	5
the	6
last	3
few	3
years	3
that	4
reputable	0
schools	2
of	5
art	2
have	4
granted	1
degrees	1
at	4
all	4
.	5

The	4
question	2
,	5
however	2
,	5
cannot	2
be	4
ignored	1
for	4
long	3
.	5

The	4
basic	2
problem	2
involved	2
is	4
that	4
a	5
college	2
setting	1
up	3
a	5
graduate	1
school	2
must	3
have	4
an	4
entirely	2
separate	1
faculty	0
for	4
the	6
advanced	1
degree	2
.	5

Most	2
professors	1
in	5
the	6
course	2
must	3
,	5
naturally	1
,	5
again	3
have	4
a	5
higher	2
degree	2
than	3
the	6
course	2
offers	1
.	5

One	2
solution	1
is	4
the	6
acquisition	0
of	5
degrees	1
in	5
education	2
but	4
it	4
is	4
a	5
poor	2
substitute	1
.	5

It	3
is	4
a	5
sort	2
of	5
academic	1
ring-around-a	0
rosy	0
and	5
you	4
solve	0
it	4
.	5

This	3
brings	1
us	3
to	5
the	6
question	2
of	5
accreditation	1
of	5
art	2
schools	2
in	5
general	2
.	5

Only	2
the	6
independent	2
art	2

that	4
is	4
,	5
those	3
not	4
connected	1
with	4
any	3
university	1

,	5
receive	1
severe	1
and	5
separate	1
investigation	1
before	3
accreditation	1
by	4
the	6
various	2
regional	1
organizations	1
.	5

It	3
has	3
been	4
the	6
custom	0
for	4
most	3
universities	1
to	5
stretch	1
the	6
blanket	1
of	5
accreditation	1
for	4
their	4
liberal	1
arts	1
school	2
to	5
cover	1
the	6
shivering	0
body	2
of	5
their	4
fine	2
arts	1
department	1
.	5

This	3
,	5
plus	1
the	6
habit	0
of	5
many	3
schools	2

adding	0
interior	2
design	2

many	3
subjects	1

yet	2
,	5
nevertheless	1
,	5
claiming	1
that	4

contributed	1
to	5
the	6
low	2
repute	0
of	5
many	3
university	1

in	5
interior	2

.	5

In	3

of	5
this	4

many	3
universities	1
offer	1
adequate	1
and	5
even	3

courses	2
in	5

There	3

Immediately	0

the	6

Physically	0
,	5
a	5
movie	1
is	4
possible	2
because	3
a	5

The	4

the	6
difference	2

really	2
one	4

In	3

change	2

the	6

Lucretius	0

``	4
The	4
reason	2

Perhaps	2

It	3
is	4
difficult	2
to	5
reconstruct	0
the	6
primeval	0
fears	1
of	5
man	3

We	3
get	3
some	3
clue	1
from	4
a	5
few	3
remembrances	0
of	5
childhood	1
and	5
from	4
the	6
circumstance	1
that	4
we	3
are	4
probably	2
not	4
much	3
more	3
afraid	1
of	5
people	3
now	3
than	3
man	3
ever	2
was	4

We	3
are	4
not	4

way	3

The	4

are	4
as	4
harmless	0
as	4

We	3

about	3
what	3

I	4
am	2
certainly	2
not	4
adequately	1
trained	1
to	5
describe	1

enlarge	0
on	4
human	2
fears	1
,	5
but	4
there	3
are	4
certain	2
features	2
of	5
the	6
fears	1
dispelled	0
by	4
scientific	1
explanations	1
that	4
stand	2
out	3
quite	2
clearly	2
.	5

They	3
are	4
in	5
general	2
those	3
fears	1
that	4
once	2
seemed	2
to	5
have	4
been	4
amenable	0
to	5
prayer	1
or	4
ritual	1
.	5

They	3
include	2
both	3
individual	2
fears	1
and	5
collective	1
ones	2
.	5

They	3
arise	1
in	5
situations	1
in	5
which	4
one	4
believes	1
that	4
what	3
happens	1
depends	1
not	4
only	3
on	4
the	6
external	1
world	3
,	5
but	4
also	3
on	4
the	6
precise	1
pattern	2
of	5
behavior	1
of	5
the	6
individual	2
or	4
group	2
.	5

Often	1
it	4
is	4
recognized	1
that	4
all	4
the	6
details	1
of	5
the	6
pattern	2
may	3
not	4
be	4
essential	1
to	5
the	6
outcome	1
but	4
,	5
because	3
the	6
pattern	2
was	4
empirically	0
determined	2
and	5
not	4
developed	2
through	3
theoretical	1
understanding	2
,	5
one	4
is	4
never	3
quite	2
certain	2
which	4
behavior	1
elements	1
are	4
effective	2
,	5
and	5
the	6
whole	2
pattern	2
becomes	2
ritualized	0
.	5

Yet	2
often	2
fear	2
persists	0
because	3
,	5
even	3
with	4
the	6
most	3
rigid	1
ritual	1
,	5
one	4
is	4
never	3
quite	2
free	2
from	4
the	6
uneasy	1
feeling	2
that	4
one	4
might	3
make	3
some	3
mistake	1
or	4
that	4
in	5
every	3
previous	2
execution	1
one	4
had	4
been	4
unaware	0
of	5
the	6
really	2
decisive	1
act	2
.	5

To	2
say	3
that	4
science	1
had	4
reduced	2
many	3
such	3
fears	1
merely	2
reiterates	0
the	6
obvious	1
and	5
frequent	1
statement	2
that	4
science	1
eliminated	1
much	3
of	5
magic	1
and	5
superstition	1
.	5

But	3
a	5
somewhat	2
more	3
detailed	1
analysis	1
of	5
this	4
process	2
may	3
be	4
illuminating	0
.	5

The	4
frequently	1
postulated	0
antique	0
worry	1
that	4
the	6
daylight	1
hours	2
might	3
dwindle	0
to	5
complete	2
darkness	1
apparently	2
gave	2
rise	2
to	5
a	5
ritual	1
and	5
celebration	0
which	4
we	3
still	3
recognize	1
.	5

It	3
is	4
curious	1
that	4
even	3
centuries	1
of	5
repetition	0
of	5
the	6
yearly	0
cycle	1
did	3
not	4
induce	0
a	5
sufficient	1
degree	2
of	5
confidence	1
to	5
allow	1
people	3
to	5
abandon	0
the	6
ceremonies	1
of	5
the	6
winter	1
solstice	0
.	5

This	3
and	5
other	3
fears	1
of	5
the	6
solar	1
system	2
have	4
disappeared	1
gradually	1
,	5
first	3
,	5
with	4
the	6
Ptolemaic	0
system	2
and	5
its	3
built-in	0
concept	1
of	5
periodicity	0
and	5
then	3
,	5
more	3
firmly	1
,	5
with	4
the	6
Newtonian	0
innovation	0
of	5
an	4
universal	1
force	2
that	4
could	3
account	2
quantitatively	0
for	4
both	3
terrestrial	0
and	5
celestial	0
motions	1
.	5

This	3
understanding	2
provides	2
a	5
very	3
simple	2
example	2
of	5
the	6
fact	2
that	4
one	4
can	3
eliminate	1
fear	2
without	2
instituting	0
any	3
controls	1
.	5

In	3
fact	2
,	5
although	2
we	3
have	4
dispelled	0
the	6
fear	2
,	5
we	3
have	4
not	4
necessarily	1
assured	1
ourselves	1
that	4
there	3
are	4
no	3
dangers	0
.	5

There	3
is	4
still	3
the	6
remote	1
possibility	1
of	5
planetoid	0
collision	0

A	3
meteor	0
could	3
fall	2
on	4
San	1

Solar	0
activities	1

long	3
periods	1
of	5
flood	1

drought	0
.	5

Our	1
understanding	2
of	5
the	6
solar	1
system	2
has	3
taught	1
us	3
to	5
replace	0
our	3
former	2
elaborate	1
rituals	0
with	4
the	6
appropriate	1
action	2
which	4
,	5
in	5
this	4
case	2
,	5
amounts	1
to	5
doing	2
nothing	2

Yet	2
we	3
no	3
longer	2
feel	2
uneasy	1

This	3
almost	2
trivial	0
example	2
is	4
nevertheless	1
suggestive	0
,	5
for	4
there	3
are	4
some	3
elements	1
in	5
common	2
between	3
the	6
antique	0
fear	2
that	4
the	6
days	2
would	4
get	3
shorter	1

shorter	1

our	3
present	2
fear	2
of	5
war	2

We	3

in	5
our	3
country	2

think	2

war	2
as	4
an	4

primarily	1

And	3
yet	2
we	3
obviously	1
also	3
believe	2
that	4
the	6
avoidance	0
of	5
the	6
disaster	1

in	5
some	3

If	3

When	3

The	4
study	2
of	5

radio	2
emission	2
of	5
the	6

began	2
with	4
the	6
detection	0
of	5
the	6
thermal	2
radiation	2
of	5
the	6

at	4
1.25	0

by	4
Dicke	0
and	5
Beringer	0
(	3

.	5

This	3
was	4
followed	2
by	4
a	5
comprehensive	1
series	2
of	5
observations	1
of	5
the	6
1.25	0

cycles	0
by	4
Piddington	0
and	5
Minnett	0
(	3

.	5

They	3
deduced	0
from	4
their	4
measurements	2
that	4
the	6
radio	2
emission	2
from	4
the	6
whole	2
disk	1
of	5
the	6
moon	2
varied	1
during	2
a	5
lunation	0
in	5
a	5
roughly	1

fashion	1
;	4
that	4

Pettit	0
(	3

;	4
and	5
that	4
the	6
maximum	2
of	5
the	6

emission	2
came	3
about	3
3	2
-	4
1	3
2	3

which	4
is	4
again	3
in	5

to	5
the	6

,	5
which	4
reaches	1
its	3
maximum	2
at	4
Full	0
Moon	1

Piddington	0
and	5
Minnett	0
explained	1
their	4
observations	1
by	4
pointing	1
out	3
that	4
rocklike	0
materials	2
which	4
are	4
likely	2
to	5
make	3
up	3
the	6
surface	3
of	5
the	6
moon	2
would	4
be	4
partially	0
transparent	1
to	5
radio	2
waves	2
,	5
although	2
opaque	0
to	5
infrared	1
radiation	2

The	4
infrared	1
emission	2
could	3
then	3
be	4
assumed	1
to	5
originate	0
at	4
the	6
surface	3
of	5
the	6
moon	2
,	5
while	3
the	6
radio	2
emission	2
originates	0
at	4
some	3
depth	2
beneath	1
the	6
surface	3
,	5
where	3
the	6
temperature	2
variation	2
due	2
to	5
solar	1
radiation	2
is	4
reduced	2
in	5
amplitude	1
and	5
shifted	1
in	5
phase	2
.	5

Since	2
the	6
absorption	1
of	5
radio	2
waves	2
in	5
rocklike	0
material	2
varies	1
with	4
wave	2
length	2
,	5
it	4
should	3
be	4
possible	2
to	5
sample	2
the	6
temperature	2
variation	2
at	4
different	2
depths	1
beneath	1
the	6
surface	3
and	5
possibly	1
detect	0
changes	2
in	5
the	6
structure	2

composition	1

only	3
if	3

The	4

that	4
it	4

The	4

To	2
measure	1
the	6

As	3

turned	2
out	3

a	5

**f	3
whereby	0
the	6

This	3
calculation	0
results	2
in	5
an	4
enthalpy	0

However	2
,	5
a	5
major	2
factor	1
in	5

This	3

In	3

dirt	1

these	3

taken	2
up	3

In	3
an	4

The	4
washing	1
process	2
whereby	0
soils	1

removed	2
consists	1
basically	1
of	5
applying	0
mechanical	1

loosen	0
the	6
dirt	1

dried	1
matter	2
in	5
the	6

to	5
some	3
extent	2

as	4
a	5

Greasy	0

in	5
plain	1
water	3

natural	2
waters	1

often	2
contain	1
impurities	1
such	3

Therefore	1

For	3

these	3

roughly	1

Obviously	1

Micelles	0

Related	0

Then	2

Substances	0

Thus	2

From	2

it	4

The	4

It	3

let	2
us	3

several	2

If	3

If	3
we	3
manage	1

keep	2
track	1
of	5
a	5
Bombus	0
queen	1
after	3
she	3
has	3
left	3
her	3

we	3
may	3
discover	1
the	6

fixed	2
up	3
for	4
herself	2
when	3

her	3

As	3
befits	0
a	5
queen	1
,	5
a	5
bumblebee	0
female	2
is	4
rather	2
choosy	0
and	5
may	3
spend	1
considerable	1
time	3
searching	1
for	4
a	5
suitable	1
nesting	0
place	3
.	5

Most	2
species	2
seem	2
to	5
prefer	1
a	5
ready-made	0
hollow	0
such	3
as	4
a	5
deserted	0
mouse	1

a	5

some	3

Once	1
she	3
has	3
made	3
up	3
her	3
mind	2

the	6
queen	1
starts	1
out	3
by	4
constructing	0

in	5
her	3
chosen	1

a	5
small	3
``	4
floor	2
''	4
of	5
dried	1
grass	1
or	4
some	3
woolly	0
material	2

On	2
this	4

she	3
builds	0
an	4
``	4
egg	1
compartment	1
''	4
or	4
``	4
egg	1
cell	1
''	4
which	4
is	4
filled	2
with	4
that	4
famous	1
pollen	1
and	5
nectar	0
mixture	1
called	2
beebread	1

She	3
also	3
builds	0
one	4
or	4
two	3
waxen	0
cups	0
which	4
she	3
fills	0
with	4
honey	1
.	5

Then	2
,	5
a	5
group	2
of	5
eggs	1
is	4
deposited	0
in	5
a	5
cavity	0
in	5
the	6
beebread	1
loaf	0
and	5
the	6
egg	1
compartment	1
is	4
closed	2
.	5

The	4
queen	1
afterward	1
keeps	1
incubating	0
and	5
guarding	0
her	3
eggs	1
like	3
a	5
mother	2
hen	1
,	5
taking	2
a	5

from	4
time	3
to	5
time	3
from	4
the	6
rather	2
liquid	1
honey	1
in	5
her	3
honey	1
pots	0
.	5

When	3
the	6
larvae	1
hatch	0
,	5
they	4
feed	2
on	4
the	6
beebread	1
,	5
although	2
they	4
also	3
receive	1
extra	1
honey	1
meals	1
from	4
their	4
mother	2
.	5

She	3
continues	1
to	5
add	1
to	5
the	6
pollen	1

as	4
needed	2

The	4
larvae	1
,	5
kept	2
warm	1
by	4
the	6
queen	1

are	4
full	2
grown	1
in	5
about	3

Each	2

After	2
another	3
two	3
weeks	2
,	5
the	6
first	3
young	2
emerge	1
,	5
four	2
to	5
eight	1
small	3

that	4
begin	2

play	2
the	6
role	2

collecting	0

in	5
the	6
field	2

while	3
the	6

retires	0
to	5
a	5
life	3
of	5

The	4

do	3
not	4
mate	1

lay	2
eggs	1

males	1
and	5
mating	0
females	1
do	3
not	4
emerge	1
until	2
later	2
in	5
the	6
season	2

The	4
broods	0
of	5
workers	1
that	4
appear	2
later	2
tend	1
to	5
be	4
bigger	1
than	3
the	6
first	3
ones	2
,	5
probably	2
because	3
they	4
are	4
better	2
fed	1
.	5

By	2
the	6
middle	2
of	5
the	6
summer	2
,	5
many	3
of	5
the	6
larvae	1
apparently	2
receive	1
such	3
a	5
good	3
diet	1
that	4
it	4
is	4
``	4
optimal	0
''	4
,	5
and	5
it	4
is	4
then	3
that	4
young	2
queens	1
begin	2
to	5
appear	2
.	5

Simultaneously	0
,	5
males	1

drones	0
are	4
produced	2

mostly	1
from	4
the	6
unfertilized	0
eggs	1
of	5
workers	1

although	2
a	5
few	3
may	3
be	4
produced	2
by	4
the	6
queen	1
.	5

The	4
young	2
queens	1
and	5
drones	0
leave	2
the	6
nest	1

mate	1

and	5
after	3
a	5
short	2
period	2
of	5
freedom	1

the	6
fertilized	0
young	2
queens	1
will	3
begin	2
to	5
dig	0
in	5
for	4
the	6
winter	1
.	5

It	3
is	4
an	4
amazing	1
fact	2
that	4
in	5
some	3
species	2
this	4
will	3
happen	1
while	3
the	6
summer	2
is	4
still	3
in	5
full	2
swing	1
,	5
for	4
instance	1
,	5
in	5
August	1

The	4
temperature	2
then	3
is	4
still	3
very	3
high	3

At	2
the	6
old	3
nest	1

the	6
queen	1
will	3
in	5
the	6
early	2
fall	2
cease	0
to	5
lay	2
the	6
fertilized	0
eggs	1
that	4
will	3
produce	1

As	3

result	2

the	6
proportion	1
of	5
males	1
(	3
which	4
leave	2
the	6

increases	1

out	3

Not	2

though	2

does	3
the	6
development	2

colony	1
take	3
place	3
in	5
the	6
smooth	1
fashion	1
we	3
have	4
just	3
described	2

Some	2
members	2

become	2
idlers	0

live	2
at	4
the	6

Bumblebees	0

suffer	1
severely	0
from	4
the	6
onslaughts	0
of	5
Psithyrus	1

the	6
``	4

it	4

The	4
one	4
sure	2
way	3
to	5
tell	2
victim	0
and	5

apart	1
is	4
to	5
examine	1
the	6

her	3
efforts	1

find	2
a	5
nest	1

When	3
she	3

The	4
hosts	0
never	3
seem	2
to	5
recognize	1
that	4
something	2
is	4
amiss	0
,	5
so	3
that	4
the	6

afterward	1
is	4
sealed	1
normally	1

Thus	2

the	6

Worse	0

But	3
let	2
us	3
return	2

after	3
this	4
gruesome	0
interlude	0

to	5
our	3
willow	1
catkins	1
in	5
the	6
spring	2
;	4
there	3
are	4
other	3
wild	1
bees	1
that	4
command	1
our	3
attention	2
.	5

It	3
is	4
almost	2
certain	2
that	4
some	3
of	5
these	3
,	5
usually	2
a	5
trifle	0
smaller	2
than	3
the	6
honeybees	0
,	5
are	4
andrenas	0

There	3
are	4
about	3
200	1
different	2
kinds	1
of	5
Andrena	1
in	5
Europe	1
alone	2

One	2
of	5
my	3
favorites	0
is	4
A.	1
armata	0
,	5
a	5
species	2
very	3
common	2
in	5
England	2
,	5
where	3
it	4
is	4
sometimes	2
referred	1
to	5
as	4
the	6
lawn	1
bee	1
.	5

The	4
females	1
like	3
to	5
burrow	0
in	5
the	6
short	2
turf	0
of	5
well-kept	0
lawns	0
,	5
where	3
their	4
little	3
mounds	0
of	5
earth	2
often	2
appear	2
by	4
the	6
hundreds	1
.	5

Almost	1
equal	2
in	5
size	2
to	5
a	5
honeybee	0
.	5

A.	1
armata	0
is	4
much	3
more	3
beautiful	1
in	5
color	2
,	5
at	4
least	2
in	5
the	6
female	2
of	5
the	6
species	2
:	3
a	5
rich	2
,	5
velvety	0
,	5
rusty	0
red	2

The	4
males	1
are	4
much	3
duller	0
.	5

After	2
having	2
mated	0
,	5
an	4
Andrena	1
female	2
digs	0
a	5
hole	1
straight	2
down	3
into	3
the	6
ground	2
,	5
forming	1
a	5
burrow	0
about	3
the	6
size	2
of	5
a	5
lead	2
pencil	1
.	5

The	4
bottom	1
part	3
of	5
a	5
burrow	0
has	3
a	5
number	3
of	5
side	2
tunnels	0
or	4
``	4
cells	2
''	4
,	5
each	3
of	5
which	4
is	4
provided	1
with	4
an	4
egg	1
plus	1
a	5
store	2
of	5
beebread	1
.	5

The	4
development	2
of	5
the	6
Andrena	1
larvae	1
is	4
very	3
rapid	1
,	5
so	3
that	4
by	4
the	6
end	2
of	5
spring	2
they	4
have	4
already	2
pupated	0
and	5
become	2
adults	1
.	5

But	3
they	4
are	4
still	3
enclosed	0
in	5
their	4
larval	0
cells	2
and	5
remain	2
there	3
throughout	2
the	6
summer	2
,	5
fall	2
,	5
and	5
winter	1
.	5

Their	1
appearance	1
,	5
next	2
spring	2
,	5
coincides	0
in	5
an	4
almost	2
uncanny	0
way	3
with	4
the	6
flowering	0
of	5
their	4
host	1
plants	2
.	5

In	3
the	6
Sacramento	0
valley	1
in	5
California	1
,	5
for	4
instance	1
,	5
it	4
has	3
been	4
observed	2
that	4
there	3
was	4
not	4
one	4
day	3
's	4
difference	2
between	3
the	6
emergence	0
of	5
the	6
andrenas	0
and	5
the	6
opening	1
of	5
the	6
willow	1
catkins	1
.	5

This	3
must	3
be	4
due	2
to	5
a	5
completely	2
identical	1

Before	1

remember	2
that	4

Thus	2

a	5

Since	2

The	4

If	3
this	4

not	4
only	3
the	6
various	2
procedures	1

mentioned	1
which	4
alter	1
the	6

that	4
emotion	1
itself	2
would	4
act	2
likewise	1

We	3
pointed	2
out	3
that	4

may	3
cure	1

This	3

raises	1
the	6
question	2
whether	2
the	6

He	4
showed	2
convincingly	0
that	4
anxiety	1

a	5

is	4
the	6
basis	2
of	5

and	5
assumed	1
,	5
therefore	2
,	5
that	4
the	6
neuronal	0
changes	2
which	4
underlie	0
the	6

are	4
functional	0
and	5
reversible	0
.	5

An	2
important	2
observation	1

served	2
as	4
a	5
guide	1
post	1
to	5
achieve	1
such	3
a	5
reversibility	0
by	4

means	2
.	5

In	3
a	5
conditioning	0
experiment	2
,	5
he	4
demonstrated	1
the	6
antagonism	1
between	3
feeding	1
and	5
pain	2
.	5

A	3
mild	0
electrical	1
shock	1
served	2
as	4
a	5
conditioned	1
stimulus	0
and	5
was	4
followed	2
by	4
feeding	1
.	5

The	4
pain	2
became	2
thus	2
the	6
symbol	1
for	4
food	1
and	5
elicited	0
salivary	0

(	3

Even	2
when	3
the	6

increased	2
gradually	1
,	5
it	4
failed	1
to	5
evoke	0
any	3
signs	1

Since	2
strong	2
nociceptive	0

produce	1
an	4

during	2
which	4
the	6
animals	1
fail	1

in	5
the	6

situation	2
,	5
Wolpe	0
thought	3
that	4
he	4
could	3
utilize	0
the	6
feeding	1
pain	2
antagonism	1
to	5
inhibit	0
the	6
neurotic	0
symptoms	1
through	3
feeding	1
.	5

Appropriate	0
experiments	2
showed	2
that	4
this	4
is	4
,	5
indeed	2
,	5
possible	2

He	4
then	3
applied	2
this	4
principle	1
of	5
reciprocal	1
inhibition	0
to	5
human	2
neuroses	0
.	5

He	4
took	2
advantage	1
of	5
the	6
antagonism	1
between	3
aggressive	1
assertiveness	0

and	5
found	3
a	5
relatively	2
rapid	1
disappearance	0
of	5
anxiety	1
when	3
the	6
former	2
attitude	2
was	4
established	2
.	5

For	3
the	6
interpretation	1
of	5
these	3
significant	1
investigations	1
,	5
it	4
should	3
be	4
remembered	1
that	4
reciprocal	1
relations	1
exist	1
in	5
the	6
hypothalamus	1
with	4
respect	2
to	5
autonomic	1
and	5
somatic	0
functions	1
which	4
are	4
closely	1
associated	2
with	4
the	6
emotions	1
.	5

The	4
feeding	1
pain	2
antagonism	1
seems	2
to	5
be	4
based	2
on	4
this	4
reciprocal	1
relation	1
between	3
the	6
tropho	0
-	4
and	5
ergotropic	0
systems	1
.	5

Furthermore	1
,	5
a	5
functional	0
antagonism	1
exists	1
between	3
an	4
aggressive	1
attitude	2
and	5
a	5
state	2
of	5
anxiety	1
.	5

Although	2
in	5
both	3
emotions	1
sympathetic	1
symptoms	1
are	4
present	2
,	5
different	2
autonomic	1
somatic	0
patterns	1
underlie	0
aggression	0
and	5
anxiety	1
,	5
respectively	1

as	4
indicated	2
by	4
the	6

The	4
psychological	1
incompatibility	0
of	5
these	3
emotional	2
states	2
seems	2
to	5
be	4
reflected	1
in	5
,	5
or	4
based	2
on	4
,	5
this	4
marked	2
difference	2

In	3

attempt	1
to	5
interpret	0
the	6
emotions	1
in	5
their	4
physiological	1

pathological	1
range	2

the	6

their	4
influence	2
on	4
the	6

We	3

i.e.	1

when	3
the	6

If	3
we	3
try	2

study	2
T	2
using	2
characteristic	2

,	5
we	3
are	4
confronted	1
with	4
two	3
problems	2
.	5

First	2
,	5
T	2
may	3
not	4
have	4
a	5
single	2
characteristic	2
value	2
;	4
this	4
is	4
really	2
a	5
deficiency	1
in	5
the	6
scalar	0
field	2
,	5
namely	1
,	5
that	4
it	4
is	4
not	4
algebraically	0
closed	2
.	5

Second	1
,	5
even	3
if	3
the	6
characteristic	2
polynomial	2
factors	1
completely	2
over	3
F	1
into	3
a	5
product	2
of	5
polynomials	1
of	5
degree	2
1	3
,	5
there	3
may	3
not	4
be	4
enough	2
characteristic	2
vectors	0
for	4
T	2
to	5
span	1
the	6
space	2
V	1
;	4
this	4
is	4
clearly	2
a	5
deficiency	1
in	5
T	2
.	5

The	4
second	2
situation	2
is	4
illustrated	1
by	4
the	6
operator	2
T	2
on	4
*	4
*	4
f	3
(	3
F	1
any	3
field	2
)	3
represented	1
in	5
the	6
standard	1
basis	2
by	4
*	4
*	4
f	3
.	5

The	4
characteristic	2
polynomial	2
for	4
A	3
is	4
*	4
*	4
f	3
and	5
this	4
is	4
plainly	1
also	3
the	6
minimal	1
polynomial	2
for	4
A	3
(	3
or	4
for	4
T	2
)	3
.	5

Thus	2
T	2
is	4
not	4
diagonalizable	1
.	5

One	2
sees	1
that	4
this	4
happens	1
because	3
the	6

hand	2
,	5

f	3
and	5
the	6
null	1

*	4
f	3
together	2
span	1
V	1

the	6
former	2
being	3
the	6
subspace	1

the	6
latter	2
the	6
subspace	1
spanned	0
by	4
*	4
*	4
f	3
and	5
*	4
*	4
f	3
.	5

This	3
will	3
be	4
more	3
or	4
less	2
our	3
general	2
method	2
for	4
the	6
second	2
problem	2
.	5

If	3
(	3
remember	2
this	4
is	4
an	4
assumption	1

the	6
minimal	1
polynomial	2
for	4
T	2
decomposes	0

*	4
f	3
where	3
*	4

f	3
are	4
distinct	1
elements	1

F	1

then	3
we	3
shall	2
show	2
that	4
the	6

is	4
the	6
direct	2
sum	1
of	5
the	6
null	1
spaces	1
of	5
*	4
*	4
f	3
.	5

The	4

special	2
case	2
of	5
this	4
in	5
which	4
*	4
*	4
f	3

The	4
theorem	1
which	4
we	3
prove	1
is	4
more	3
general	2
than	3
what	3
we	3
have	4
described	2

since	3
it	4
works	2
with	4
the	6

whether	2

the	6

all	4

The	4
reader	1

find	2
it	4

to	5
think	2
of	5

when	3
the	6

even	3

to	5

Let	2

Let	2

then	3
the	6

The	4
idea	2

this	4

If	3
the	6

how	3

we	3
get	3

of	5
the	6
projections	1

f	3
associated	2
with	4
the	6

The	4
projection	1

will	3
be	4

on	4

We	3

For	3

Since	2

Thus	2

Since	2

p	1

we	3
have	4

f	3

Thus	2
the	6

are	4
projections	1
which	4
correspond	1
to	5
some	3

We	3
wish	1
to	5
show	2
that	4
the	6
range	2
of	5

f	3
is	4
exactly	2
the	6
subspace	1

It	3
is	4
clear	2
that	4
each	3

then	3
*	4

f	3
and	5
so	3

f	3
because	3

f	3
is	4
divisible	0
by	4
the	6

Conversely	0

suppose	1
that	4

If	3

then	3

f	3
is	4
divisible	0

so	3

*	4
f	3
,	5
i.e.	1

But	3
then	3
it	4
is	4
immediate	1
that	4

i.e.	1

that	4

This	3
completes	0
the	6

It	3
is	4
certainly	2
clear	2
that	4

If	3

f	3
is	4
the	6
operator	2
induced	1
on	4

f	3
by	4

then	3
evidently	1
*	4
*	4
f	3

because	3
by	4

f	3
is	4
0	2
on	4
the	6

f	3

This	3
shows	1
that	4
the	6

polynomial	2
for	4

f	3
divides	0
*	4
*	4
f	3
.	5

Conversely	0
,	5
let	2
g	1
be	4
any	3
polynomial	2
such	3
that	4
*	4
*	4
f	3

Then	2
*	4
*	4
f	3

Thus	2

*	4
f	3
is	4
divisible	0
by	4
the	6

p	1

i.e.	1

f	3

f	3

It	3
is	4
easily	1
seen	2
that	4

f	3
divides	0
g	1

Hence	1
the	6

f	3

If	3

are	4
the	6

then	3
each	3

accordingly	0
if	3

Now	2
the	6

Let	2

By	2
Theorem	1

The	4

When	3

we	3

Let	2

We	3
say	3

Let	2

Suppose	1
that	4

decomposes	0
over	3

Then	2
there	3

The	4

each	3

We	3
have	4
just	3
observed	2
that	4
we	3
can	3
write	2
*	4
*	4
f	3
where	3
D	2
is	4
diagonalizable	1

where	3
D	2
and	5
N	1
not	4
only	3
commute	1
but	4
are	4
polynomials	1
in	5

Now	2
suppose	1
that	4
we	3
also	3
have	4
*	4
*	4
f	3
where	3
D	2
'	3
is	4
diagonalizable	1
,	5
N	1

and	5
*	4
*	4
f	3
.	5

We	3
shall	2
prove	1
that	4
*	4
*	4
f	3
.	5

Since	2
D	2
'	3
and	5
N	1
'	3
commute	1
with	4
one	4
another	3
and	5
*	4
*	4
f	3
,	5
we	3
see	3
that	4
D	2

N	1

commute	1
with	4
T	2

Thus	2
D	2
'	3
and	5
N	1

commute	1
with	4
any	3
polynomial	2
in	5
T	2
;	4
hence	1
they	4
commute	1
with	4
D	2
and	5
with	4
N	1

Now	2
we	3
have	4

f	3

f	3
and	5
all	4
four	2
of	5
these	3

commute	1
with	4

Since	2

both	3
diagonalizable	1

they	4
commute	1

they	4
are	4
simultaneously	1

and	5

f	3
is	4

Since	2
N	1

are	4
both	3
nilpotent	1
and	5
they	4
commute	1
,	5
the	6
operator	2

f	3
is	4
nilpotent	1

for	4

using	2
the	6
fact	2
that	4
N	1
and	5
N	1
'	3
commute	1
*	4
*	4
f	3
and	5
so	3
when	3
r	0
is	4
sufficiently	1
large	2
every	3
term	1
in	5
this	4
expression	2
for	4
*	4
*	4
f	3
will	3
be	4
0	2
.	5

(	3
Actually	0
,	5
a	5
nilpotent	1
operator	2
on	4
an	4
n-dimensional	0
space	2
must	3
have	4
its	3
nth	0
power	2
0	2
;	4
if	3
we	3
take	3
*	4
*	4
f	3
above	2
,	5
that	4
will	3
be	4
large	2
enough	2
.	5

It	3
then	3
follows	2
that	4
*	4
*	4
f	3
is	4
large	2
enough	2
,	5
but	4
this	4
is	4
not	4
obvious	1
from	4
the	6
above	2
expression	2
.	5
)	3

Now	2
*	4
*	4
f	3
is	4
a	5
diagonalizable	1
operator	2
which	4
is	4
also	3
nilpotent	1
.	5

Such	1
an	4
operator	2
is	4
obviously	1
the	6
zero	1
operator	2
;	4
for	4
since	3
it	4
is	4
nilpotent	1
,	5
the	6
minimal	1
polynomial	2
for	4
this	4
operator	2
is	4
of	5
the	6
form	2
*	4
*	4
f	3
for	4
some	3
*	4
*	4
f	3
;	4
but	4
then	3
since	3
the	6
operator	2
is	4
diagonalizable	1
,	5
the	6
minimal	1
polynomial	2
cannot	2
have	4
a	5
repeated	1
root	1
;	4
hence	1
*	4
*	4
f	3
and	5
the	6
minimal	1
polynomial	2
is	4
simply	2
x	1
,	5
which	4
says	2
the	6
operator	2
is	4
0	2
.	5

Thus	2
we	3
see	3
that	4
*	4
*	4
f	3
and	5
*	4
*	4
f	3
.	5

Let	2
V	1
be	4
a	5
finite	1
dimensional	1
vector	1
space	2
over	3
an	4
algebraically	0
closed	2
field	2
F	1
,	5
e.g.	0
,	5
the	6
field	2
of	5
complex	1
numbers	2
.	5

Then	2
every	3
linear	1
operator	2
T	2
on	4
V	1
can	3
be	4
written	2
as	4
the	6
sum	1
of	5
a	5
diagonalizable	1
operator	2
D	2
and	5
a	5
nilpotent	1
operator	2
N	1
which	4
commute	1
.	5

These	2
operators	1
D	2
and	5
N	1
are	4
unique	1
and	5
each	3
is	4
a	5
polynomial	2
in	5
T	2
.	5

From	2
these	3
results	2
,	5
one	4
sees	1
that	4
the	6
study	2
of	5
linear	1
operators	1
on	4
vector	1
spaces	1
over	3
an	4
algebraically	0
closed	2
field	2
is	4
essentially	1
reduced	2
to	5
the	6
study	2
of	5
nilpotent	1
operators	1
.	5

For	3
vector	1
spaces	1
over	3
non	2
algebraically	0
closed	2
fields	1
,	5
we	3
still	3
need	2
to	5
find	2
some	3
substitute	1
for	4
characteristic	2
values	2
and	5
vectors	0
.	5

It	3
is	4
a	5
very	3
interesting	1
fact	2
that	4
these	3
two	3
problems	2
can	3
be	4
handled	1
simultaneously	1
and	5
this	4
is	4
what	3
we	3
shall	2
do	3
in	5
the	6
next	2
chapter	1

In	3
concluding	0
this	4
section	1

we	3
should	3
like	3
to	5
give	2
an	4
example	2
which	4
illustrates	0
some	3
of	5
the	6
ideas	1
of	5
the	6
primary	2

We	3
have	4
chosen	1
to	5
give	2
it	4
at	4
the	6
end	2
of	5
the	6
section	1
since	3
it	4
deals	1
with	4
differential	1
equations	0
and	5
thus	2
is	4
not	4
purely	1
linear	1
algebra	0

In	3
the	6

decomposition	1
theorem	1

it	4
is	4
not	4
necessary	2
that	4
the	6

is	4
it	4
necessary	2
for	4

(	3

that	4
p	1
be	4
the	6

If	3
T	2
is	4
a	5
linear	1

on	4

if	3
there	3

a	5

p	1
such	3
that	4

then	3

(	3

Theorem	1

are	4
valid	1
for	4
T	2
with	4
the	6
proof	1
which	4
we	3
gave	2
.	5

Let	2
n	1
be	4
a	5
positive	1

and	5
let	2
V	1
be	4
the	6

If	3

f	3
denotes	0
the	6
space	2
of	5

then	3
the	6

V	1
of	5

of	5
this	4

is	4
a	5
subspace	1
of	5

f	3

If	3
D	2
denotes	0
the	6
differentiation	0
operator	2
and	5
p	1
is	4
the	6

f	3
then	3
V	1
is	4
the	6

(	3

because	3

f	3

Let	2
us	3
now	3
regard	2
D	2
as	4
a	5
linear	1
operator	2
on	4
the	6

V	1

Then	2
*	4
*	4
f	3
.	5

If	3
we	3
are	4
discussing	1
differentiable	0
complex	1

functions	1
,	5
then	3
*	4

f	3

V	1
are	4

and	5
*	4

f	3
may	3

We	3
now	3
write	2

f	3
where	3

If	3

f	3
is	4
the	6
null	1

*	4
f	3
,	5
then	3
Theorem	1
12	2
says	2
that	4
*	4
*	4
f	3
.	5

In	3
other	3
words	2
,	5
if	3
f	3
satisfies	0
the	6

then	3
f	3
is	4

where	3

the	6

Thus	2
,	5
the	6
study	2
of	5
the	6
solutions	1
to	5
the	6

f	3
is	4

However	2

We	3

For	3
an	4
experiment	2
to	5
qualify	0
as	4
a	5
binomial	2
experiment	2
,	5
it	4
must	3
have	4
four	2
properties	1

(	3

be	4
a	5
fixed	2
number	3

Below	1
we	3
use	3
our	3
earlier	2
examples	1
to	5
describe	1
and	5
illustrate	1
these	3
four	2
properties	1
.	5

We	3
also	3
give	2

for	4
each	3
property	2

an	4
example	2
where	3
the	6

The	4
language	1

notation	0
introduced	1
are	4
standard	1
throughout	2

chapter	1

For	3
the	6

we	3
study	2
sets	1

(	3

for	4
the	6

Toss	0

Here	2
the	6

Each	2

``	4

just	3

when	3

talk	2
about	3

These	2

It	3
is	4
natural	2
from	4
the	6
marksman	1
's	4
viewpoint	1
to	5
call	2
a	5
bull's-eye	1
a	5
success	2

but	4
in	5
the	6
mice	1

it	4
is	4
arbitrary	0
which	4

The	4
word	2
``	4
binomial	2

``	4

``	4

Sometimes	1
when	3
there	3

group	2
these	3

two	3
classes	1

the	6
example	2

arbitrarily	0
constructed	1
the	6
classes	1
``	4

``	4

We	3

``	4

but	4
a	5

We	3
can	3
escape	1

such	3

difficulty	1
by	4
ruling	0
out	3
the	6
animal	1
as	4

constituting	0
a	5
trial	2

such	3

Each	2

has	3
probability	1

f	3
of	5
producing	1

the	6

perhaps	2
0.1	1

of	5
making	2

Note	1

lowering	0
his	4

Strictly	0
speaking	1

this	4
means	2
that	4
the	6
probability	1
for	4

Thus	2
we	3

in	5
every	3

in	5
the	6
C-plane	1

**f	3
meets	0
both	3
the	6

Any	1

intersection	1
between	3
C	2
and	5
**f	3
will	3
be	4
called	2
a	5

point	2

This	3
terminology	0
will	3
also	3
be	4
applied	2
to	5
the	6

points	2

We	3
can	3
now	3
prove	1
several	2
lemmas	0
.	5

In	3
some	3
neighborhood	2
in	5
the	6
f-plane	1
of	5
any	3
ordinary	2
point	2
of	5
the	6
graph	1
,	5
the	6
function	2
f	3
is	4
a	5
single	2
valued	1
,	5
continuous	1
function	2
.	5

We	3
first	3
show	2
that	4
the	6
function	2
is	4
single	2
valued	1
in	5
some	3
neighborhood	2
.	5

With	2
the	6
vertex	1
at	4
**f	3
in	5
the	6
C-plane	1
we	3
assume	1
that	4
**f	3
is	4
the	6
parametric	0
location	1
on	4
C	2
of	5
an	4
ordinary	2
intersection	1
Q	1
between	3
C	2
and	5
**f	3
.	5

In	3
the	6
f-plane	1
the	6
coordinates	0
of	5
the	6
corresponding	1
point	2
are	4
**f	3
.	5

We	3
know	3
that	4
in	5
the	6
C-plane	1
both	3
C	2
and	5
**f	3
are	4
analytic	1
.	5

In	3
the	6
C-plane	1
we	3
construct	0
a	5
set	2
of	5
rectangular	0
Cartesian	0
coordinates	0
u	0
,	5
v	0
with	4
the	6
origin	1
at	4
Q	1
and	5
such	3
that	4
both	3
C	2
and	5
**f	3
have	4
finite	1
slope	1
at	4
Q	1
.	5

Near	0
Q	1
,	5
both	3
curves	1
can	3
be	4
represented	1
by	4
analytic	1
functions	1
of	5
u	0
.	5

In	3
a	5
neighborhood	2
of	5
Q	1
the	6
difference	2
between	3
these	3
functions	1
is	4
also	3
a	5
single	2
valued	1
,	5
analytic	1
function	2
of	5
u	0
.	5

Furthermore	1
,	5
one	4
can	3
find	2
a	5
neighborhood	2
of	5
Q	1
in	5
which	4
the	6
difference	2
function	2
is	4
monotone	0
,	5
for	4
since	3
it	4
is	4
analytic	1
it	4
can	3
have	4
only	3
a	5
finite	1
number	3
of	5
extrema	0
in	5
any	3
interval	1
.	5

Now	2
,	5
to	5
find	2
**f	3
,	5
one	4
needs	2
the	6
intersection	1
of	5
C	2
and	5
**f	3
near	2
Q	1
.	5

But	3
**f	3
is	4
just	3
the	6
curve	1
**f	3
translated	1
without	2
rotation	0
through	3
a	5
small	3
arc	2
,	5
for	4
**f	3
is	4
always	2
obtained	2
by	4
rotating	1
C	2
through	3
exactly	2
90	1
`	2
.	5

The	4
arc	2
is	4
itself	2
a	5
segment	0
of	5
an	4
analytic	1
curve	1
.	5

Thus	2
if	3
e	0
is	4
sufficiently	1
small	3
,	5
there	3
can	3
be	4
only	3
one	4
intersection	1
of	5
C	2
and	5
**f	3
near	2
Q	1
,	5
for	4
if	3
there	3
were	4
more	3
than	3
one	4
intersection	1
for	4
every	3
e	0
then	3
the	6
difference	2
between	3
C	2
and	5
**f	3
near	2
Q	1
would	4
not	4
be	4
a	5
monotone	0
function	2
.	5

Therefore	1
,	5
**f	3
is	4
single	2
valued	1
near	2
Q	1
.	5

It	3
is	4
also	3
seen	2
that	4
**f	3
,	5
since	3
the	6
change	2
from	4
**f	3
to	5
**f	3
is	4
accomplished	1
by	4
a	5
continuous	1
translation	1
.	5

Thus	2
**f	3
is	4
also	3
continuous	1
at	4
**f	3
,	5
and	5
in	5
a	5
neighborhood	2
of	5
**f	3
which	4
does	3
not	4
contain	1
a	5
tangent	1
point	2
.	5

We	3
turn	2
now	3
to	5
the	6
set	2
of	5
tangent	1
points	2
on	4
the	6
graph	1
.	5

This	3
set	2
must	3
consist	0
of	5
isolated	1
points	2
and	5
closed	2
intervals	1
.	5

The	4
fact	2
that	4
there	3
can	3
not	4
be	4
any	3
limit	1
points	2
of	5
the	6
set	2
except	2
in	5
closed	2
intervals	1
follows	2
from	4
the	6
argument	2
used	3
in	5
Lemma	0
1	3
,	5
namely	1
,	5
that	4
near	2
any	3
tangent	1
point	2
in	5
the	6
C-plane	1
the	6
curves	1
C	2
and	5
**f	3
are	4
analytic	1
,	5
and	5
therefore	2
the	6
difference	2
between	3
them	3
must	3
be	4
a	5
monotone	0
function	2
in	5
some	3
neighborhood	2
on	4
either	2
side	2
of	5
the	6
tangent	1
point	2
.	5

This	3
prevents	1
the	6
occurrence	1
of	5
an	4
infinite	1
sequence	1
of	5
isolated	1
tangent	1
points	2
.	5

In	3
some	3
neighborhood	2
of	5
an	4
isolated	1
tangent	1
point	2
in	5
the	6
f-plane	1
,	5
say	3
**f	3
,	5
the	6
function	2
**f	3
is	4
either	2
double	1
valued	1
or	4
has	3
no	3
values	2
defined	1
,	5
except	2
at	4
the	6
tangent	1
point	2
itself	2
,	5
where	3
it	4
is	4
single	2
valued	1
.	5

A	3
tangent	1
point	2
Q	1
in	5
the	6
C-plane	1
occurs	1
when	3
C	2
and	5
**f	3
are	4
tangent	1
to	5
one	4
another	3
.	5

A	3
continuous	1
change	2
in	5
t	2
through	3
an	4
amount	2
e	0
results	2
in	5
a	5
translation	1
along	2
an	4
analytic	1
arc	2
of	5
the	6
curve	1
**f	3
.	5

There	3
are	4
three	3
possibilities	1
:	3
(	3
a	5
)	3
**f	3
remains	2
tangent	1
to	5
C	2
as	4
it	4
is	4
translated	1
;	4
(	3
b	1
)	3
**f	3
moves	1
away	3
from	4
C	2
and	5
does	3
not	4
intersect	0
it	4
at	4
all	4
for	4
**f	3
;	4
(	3
c	1
)	3
**f	3
cuts	1
across	2
C	2
and	5
there	3
are	4
two	3
ordinary	2
intersections	1
for	4
every	3
t	2
in	5
**f	3
.	5

The	4
first	3
possibility	1
results	2
in	5
a	5
closed	2
interval	1
of	5
tangent	1
points	2
in	5
the	6
f-plane	1
,	5
the	6
end	2
points	2
of	5
which	4
fall	2
into	3
category	1
(	3
b	1
)	3
or	4
(	3
c	1
)	3
.	5

In	3
the	6
second	2
category	1
the	6
function	2
**f	3
has	3
no	3
values	2
defined	1
in	5
a	5
neighborhood	2
**f	3
.	5

In	3
the	6
third	2
category	1
the	6
function	2
is	4
double	1
valued	1
in	5
this	4
interval	1
.	5

The	4
same	3
remarks	1
apply	1
to	5
an	4
interval	1
on	4
the	6
other	3
side	2
of	5
**f	3
.	5

Again	1
,	5
the	6
analyticity	0
of	5
the	6
two	3
curves	1
guarantee	0
that	4
such	3
intervals	1
exist	1
.	5

In	3
the	6
neighborhood	2
of	5
an	4
end	2
point	2
of	5
an	4
interval	1
of	5
tangent	1
points	2
in	5
the	6
f-plane	1
the	6
function	2
is	4
two	3
valued	1
or	4
no	3
valued	1
on	4
one	4
side	2
,	5
and	5
is	4
a	5
single	2
valued	1
function	2
consisting	1
entirely	2
of	5
tangent	1
points	2
on	4
the	6
other	3
side	2
.	5

With	2
the	6
above	2
results	2
we	3
can	3
make	3
the	6
following	2
remarks	1
about	3
the	6
graph	1
of	5
f	3
.	5

First	2
,	5
for	4
any	3
value	2
of	5
t	2
for	4
which	4
all	4
values	2
of	5
f	3
(	3
t	2
)	3
are	4
ordinary	2
points	2
the	6
number	3
of	5
values	2
of	5
f	3
(	3
t	2
)	3
must	3
be	4
odd	1
.	5

For	3
it	4
is	4
clear	2
that	4
the	6
total	2
number	3
of	5
ordinary	2
intersections	1
of	5
C	2
and	5
**f	3
must	3
be	4
even	3
(	3
otherwise	1
,	5
starting	1
in	5
the	6
interior	2
of	5
C	2
,	5
**f	3
could	3
not	4
finally	2
return	2
to	5
the	6
interior	2
)	3
,	5
and	5
the	6
center	2
of	5
rotation	0
at	4
t	2
is	4
the	6
argument	2
of	5
the	6
function	2
,	5
not	4
a	5
value	2
.	5

Therefore	1
,	5
for	4
any	3
value	2
of	5
t	2
the	6
number	3
of	5
values	2
of	5
f	3
(	3
t	2
)	3
is	4
equal	2
to	5
the	6
(	3
finite	1
)	3
number	3
of	5
tangent	1
points	2
corresponding	1
to	5
the	6
argument	2
t	2
plus	1
an	4
odd	1
number	3
.	5

The	4
number	3
of	5
ordinary	2
values	2
of	5
the	6
function	2
f	3
(	3
t	2
)	3
at	4
t	2
will	3
be	4
called	2
its	3
multiplicity	1
at	4
t	2
.	5

The	4
graph	1
of	5
f	3
has	3
at	4
least	2
one	4
component	1
whose	2
support	2
is	4
the	6
entire	2
interval	1
[	2
0	2
,	5
T	2
]	2
.	5

We	3
suppose	1
not	4
.	5

Then	2
every	3
component	1
of	5
the	6
graph	1
of	5
f	3
must	3
be	4
defined	1
over	3
a	5
bounded	1
sub-interval	0
.	5

Suppose	1
**f	3
is	4
defined	1
in	5
the	6
sub-interval	0
**f	3
.	5

Now	2
**f	3
and	5
**f	3
must	3
both	3
be	4
tangent	1
points	2
on	4
the	6
nth	0
component	1
in	5
the	6
f-plane	1
;	4
otherwise	1
by	4
Lemma	0
1	3
the	6
component	1
would	4
extend	1
beyond	2
these	3
points	2
.	5

Further	1
,	5
we	3
see	3
by	4
Lemma	0
2	3
that	4
the	6
multiplicity	1
of	5
f	3
can	3
only	3
change	2
at	4
a	5
tangent	1
point	2
,	5
and	5
at	4
such	3
a	5
point	2
can	3
only	3
change	2
by	4
an	4
even	3
integer	0
.	5

Thus	2
the	6
multiplicity	1
of	5
**f	3
for	4
a	5
given	2
t	2
must	3
be	4
an	4
even	3
number	3
.	5

This	3
is	4
true	2
of	5
all	4
components	1
which	4
have	4
such	3
a	5
bounded	1
support	2
.	5

But	3
this	4
is	4
a	5
contradiction	0
,	5
for	4
we	3
know	3
that	4
the	6
multiplicity	1
of	5
f	3
(	3
t	2
)	3
is	4
odd	1
for	4
every	3
t	2
.	5

We	3
have	4
shown	2
that	4
the	6
graph	1
of	5
f	3
contains	1
at	4
least	2
one	4
component	1
whose	2
inverse	0
is	4
the	6
entire	2
interval	1
[	2
0	2
,	5
T	2
]	2
,	5
and	5
whose	2
multiplicity	1
is	4
odd	1
.	5

There	3
must	3
be	4
an	4
odd	1
number	3
of	5
such	3
components	1
,	5
which	4
will	3
be	4
called	2
complete	2
components	1
.	5

The	4
remaining	1
(	3
incomplete	1
)	3
components	1
all	4
have	4
an	4
even	3
number	3
of	5
ordinary	2
points	2
at	4
any	3
argument	2
,	5
and	5
are	4
defined	1
only	3
on	4
a	5
proper	1
sub-interval	0
of	5
[	2
0	2
,	5
T	2
]	2
.	5

We	3
must	3
now	3
show	2
that	4
on	4
some	3
component	1
of	5
the	6
graph	1
there	3
exist	1
two	3
points	2
for	4
which	4
the	6
corresponding	1
diagonal	0
points	2
in	5
the	6
C-plane	1
are	4
on	4
opposite	1
sides	1
of	5
C	2
.	5

We	3
again	3
consider	2
a	5
fixed	2
point	2
P	1
at	4
**f	3
and	5
a	5
variable	1
point	2
Q	1
at	4
**f	3
on	4
C	2
.	5

We	3
erect	1
a	5
square	2
with	4
PQ	0
as	4
a	5
side	2
and	5
with	4
free	2
corners	1
**f	3
and	5
**f	3
adjacent	1
to	5
P	1
and	5
Q	1
respectively	1
.	5

As	3
s	1
varies	1
from	4
zero	1
to	5
T	2
,	5
the	6
values	2
of	5
s	1
for	4
which	4
**f	3
and	5
**f	3
cross	1
C	2
will	3
be	4
denoted	1
by	4
**f	3
and	5
**f	3
respectively	1
.	5

We	3
have	4
**f	3
,	5
plus	1
tangent	1
points	2
.	5

These	2
s-values	0
are	4
just	3
the	6
ordinary	2
values	2
of	5
**f	3
.	5

The	4
values	2
**f	3
are	4
the	6
ordinary	2
values	2
at	4
**f	3
of	5
a	5
multi	0
valued	1
function	2
g	1
(	3
t	2
)	3
which	4
has	3
components	1
corresponding	1
to	5
those	3
of	5
f	3
(	3
t	2
)	3
.	5

We	3
first	3
define	1
a	5
function	2
b	1
(	3
t	2
)	3
as	4
follows	2
:	3
given	2
the	6
set	2
of	5
squares	1
such	3
that	4
each	3
has	3
three	3
corners	1
on	4
C	2
and	5
vertex	1
at	4
t	2
,	5
b	1
(	3
t	2
)	3
is	4
the	6
corresponding	1
set	2
of	5
positive	1
parametric	0
differences	2
between	3
t	2
and	5
the	6
backward	1
corner	2
points	2
.	5

The	4
functions	1
f	3
and	5
b	1
have	4
exactly	2
the	6
same	3
multiplicity	1
at	4
every	3
argument	2
t	2
.	5

Now	2
with	4
P	1
fixed	2
at	4
**f	3
,	5
**f-values	0
occur	1
when	3
the	6
corner	2
**f	3
crosses	0
C	2
,	5
and	5
are	4
among	2
the	6
values	2
of	5
s	1
such	3
that	4
**f	3
.	5

The	4
roots	1
of	5
this	4
equation	1
are	4
just	3
the	6
ordinates	0
of	5
the	6
intersections	1
of	5
the	6
graph	1
of	5
b	1
with	4
a	5
straight	2
line	2
of	5
unit	2
slope	1
through	3
**f	3
in	5
the	6
b-plane	0
(	3
the	6
plane	1
of	5
the	6
graph	1
of	5
b	1
)	3
.	5

We	3
define	1
these	3
values	2
as	4
**f	3
,	5
and	5
define	1
g	1
(	3
t	2
)	3
in	5
the	6
same	3
way	3
for	4
each	3
t	2
.	5

Thus	2
we	3
obtain	1
g	1
(	3

introducing	0
an	4

registration	1
process	2
into	3
a	5
kind	2
of	5
competition	1
among	2
provincial	1
officials	1
.	5

A	3
goal	1
was	4
fixed	2
,	5
as	4
given	2
in	5
Table	1
2	3
,	5
and	5
attention	2
focused	0
on	4
its	3
fulfillment	1
.	5

The	4
qualifications	1
to	5
vote	1
were	4
kept	2
very	3
simple	2
.	5

Both	1
men	3
and	5
women	2
of	5
twenty-one	0
years	3
of	5
age	2
could	3
register	1
and	5
vote	1
upon	2
presenting	1
proof	1
of	5
residence	1
and	5
identification	1
.	5

There	3
were	4
liberal	1
provisions	0
for	4
dispensation	0
where	3
documents	0
or	4
records	2
were	4
lacking	1
.	5

The	4
police	1
were	4
disqualified	0
along	2
with	4
certain	2
categories	1
of	5
naturalized	0
citizens	1
,	5
criminals	0
and	5
those	3
punished	1
for	4
Protectorate	0
activities	1
.	5

The	4
registration	1
figures	2
given	2
in	5
Table	1
2	3
must	3
be	4
interpreted	1
with	4
caution	0
since	3
the	6
estimate	1
for	4
eligible	1
electors	0
were	4
made	3
without	2
the	6
benefit	1
of	5
a	5
reliable	1
census	0
.	5

But	3
neither	2
was	4
the	6
statement	2
empirical	0
,	5
for	4
goodness	1
was	4
not	4
a	5
quality	2
like	3
red	2
or	4
squeaky	0
that	4
could	3
be	4
seen	2
or	4
heard	2
.	5

What	3
were	4
they	4
to	5
do	3
,	5
then	3
,	5
with	4
these	3
awkward	0
judgments	1
of	5
value	2
?	4

To	2
find	2
a	5
place	3
for	4
them	3
in	5
their	4
theory	2
of	5
knowledge	2
would	4
require	1
them	3
to	5
revise	0
the	6
theory	2
radically	1
,	5
and	5
yet	2
that	4
theory	2
was	4
what	3
they	4
regarded	1
as	4
their	4
most	3
important	2
discovery	1
.	5

It	3
appeared	2
that	4
the	6
theory	2
could	3
be	4
saved	1
in	5
one	4
way	3
only	3
.	5

If	3
it	4
could	3
be	4
shown	2
that	4
judgments	1
of	5
good	3
and	5
bad	2
were	4
not	4
judgments	1
at	4
all	4
,	5
that	4
they	4
asserted	0
nothing	2
true	2
or	4
false	1
,	5
but	4
merely	2
expressed	1
emotions	1
like	3
``	4
Hurrah	0
''	4
or	4
``	4
Fiddlesticks	0
''	4
,	5
then	3
these	3
wayward	0
judgments	1
would	4
cease	0
from	4
troubling	0
and	5
weary	1
heads	1
could	3
be	4
at	4
rest	2
.	5

This	3
is	4
the	6
course	2
the	6
positivists	0
took	2
.	5

They	3
explained	1
value	2
judgments	1
by	4
explaining	0
them	3
away	3
.	5

Now	2
I	4
do	3
not	4
think	2
their	4
view	2
will	3
do	3
.	5

But	3
before	3
discussing	1
it	4
,	5
I	4
should	3
like	3
to	5
record	2
one	4
vote	1
of	5
thanks	1
to	5
them	3
for	4
the	6
clarity	1
with	4
which	4
they	4
have	4
stated	1
their	4
case	2
.	5

It	3
has	3
been	4
said	3
of	5
John	2
Stuart	1
Mill	0
that	4
he	4
wrote	2
so	3
clearly	2
that	4
he	4
could	3
be	4
found	3
out	3
.	5

This	3
theory	2
has	3
been	4
put	2
so	3
clearly	2
and	5
precisely	1
that	4
it	4
deserves	1
criticism	1
of	5
the	6
same	3
kind	2
,	5
and	5
this	4
I	4
will	3
do	3
my	3
best	2
to	5
supply	2
.	5

The	4
theory	2
claims	1
to	5
show	2
by	4
analysis	1
that	4
when	3
we	3
say	3
,	5
``	4
That	3
is	4
good	3
''	4
,	5
we	3
do	3
not	4
mean	2
to	5
assert	1
a	5
character	2
of	5
the	6
subject	2
of	5
which	4
we	3
are	4
thinking	1
.	5

I	4
shall	2
argue	0
that	4
we	3
do	3
mean	2
to	5
do	3
just	3
that	4
.	5

Let	2
us	3
work	3
through	3
an	4
example	2
,	5
and	5
the	6
simpler	0
and	5
commoner	0
the	6
better	2
.	5

There	3
is	4
perhaps	2
no	3
value	2
statement	2
on	4
which	4
people	3
would	4
more	3
universally	0
agree	1
than	3
the	6
statement	2
that	4
intense	1
pain	2
is	4
bad	2
.	5

Let	2
us	3
take	3
a	5
set	2
of	5
circumstances	2
in	5
which	4
I	4
happen	1
to	5
be	4
interested	1
on	4
the	6
legislative	0
side	2
and	5
in	5
which	4
I	4
think	2
every	3
one	4
of	5
us	3
might	3
naturally	1
make	3
such	3
a	5
statement	2
.	5

We	3
come	3
upon	2
a	5
rabbit	1
that	4
has	3
been	4
caught	2
in	5
one	4
of	5
the	6
brutal	0
traps	0
in	5
common	2
use	3
.	5

There	3
are	4
signs	1
that	4
it	4
has	3
struggled	0
for	4
days	2
to	5
escape	1
and	5
that	4
in	5
a	5
frenzy	0
of	5
hunger	0
,	5
pain	2
,	5
and	5
fear	2
,	5
it	4
has	3
all	4
but	4
eaten	0
off	3
its	3
own	3
leg	2
.	5

The	4
attempt	1
failed	1
:	3
the	6
animal	1
is	4
now	3
dead	2
.	5

As	3
we	3
think	2
of	5
the	6
long	3
and	5
excruciating	0
pain	2
it	4
must	3
have	4
suffered	1
,	5
we	3
are	4
very	3
likely	2
to	5
say	3
:	3
``	4
It	3
was	4
a	5
bad	2
thing	2
that	4
the	6
little	3
animal	1
should	3
suffer	1
so	3
''	4
.	5

The	4
positivist	1
tells	1
us	3
that	4
when	3
we	3
say	3
this	4
we	3
are	4
only	3
expressing	1
our	3
present	2
emotion	1
.	5

I	4
hold	2
,	5
on	4
the	6
contrary	1
,	5
that	4
we	3
mean	2
to	5
assert	1
something	2
of	5
the	6
pain	2
itself	2
,	5
namely	1
,	5
that	4
it	4
was	4
bad	2
-	4
bad	2
when	3
and	5
as	4
it	4
occurred	2
.	5

Consider	1
what	3
follows	2
from	4
the	6
positivist	1
view	2
.	5

On	2
that	4
view	2
,	5
nothing	2
good	3
or	4
bad	2
happened	2
in	5
the	6
case	2
until	2
I	4
came	3
on	4
the	6
scene	2
and	5
made	3
my	3
remark	1
.	5

For	3
what	3
I	4
express	1
in	5
my	3
remark	1
is	4
something	2
going	2
on	4
in	5
me	3
at	4
the	6
time	3
,	5
and	5
that	4
of	5
course	2
did	3
not	4
exist	1
until	2
I	4
did	3
come	3
on	4
the	6
scene	2
.	5

The	4
pain	2
of	5
the	6
rabbit	1
was	4
not	4
itself	2
bad	2
;	4
nothing	2
evil	1
was	4
happening	1
when	3
that	4
pain	2
was	4
being	3
endured	0
;	4
badness	1
,	5
in	5
the	6
only	3
sense	2
in	5
which	4
it	4
is	4
involved	2
at	4
all	4
,	5
waited	1
for	4
its	3
appearance	1
till	1
I	4
came	3
and	5
looked	2
and	5
felt	2
.	5

Now	2
that	4
this	4
is	4
at	4
odds	0
with	4
our	3
meaning	2
may	3
be	4
shown	2
as	4
follows	2
.	5

Let	2
us	3
put	2
to	5
ourselves	1
the	6
hypothesis	0
that	4
we	3
had	4
not	4
come	3
on	4
the	6
scene	2
and	5
that	4
the	6
rabbit	1
never	3
was	4
discovered	1
.	5

Are	2
we	3
prepared	2
to	5
say	3
that	4
in	5
that	4
case	2
nothing	2
bad	2
occurred	2
in	5
the	6
sense	2
in	5
which	4
we	3
said	3
it	4
did	3
?	4

Clearly	0
not	4
.	5

Indeed	1
we	3
should	3
say	3
,	5
on	4
the	6
contrary	1
,	5
that	4
the	6
accident	1
of	5
our	3
later	2
discovery	1
made	3
no	3
difference	2
whatever	1
to	5
the	6
badness	1
of	5
the	6
animal	1
's	4
pain	2
,	5
that	4
it	4
would	4
have	4
been	4
every	3
whit	0
as	4
bad	2
whether	2
a	5
chance	1
passer-by	0
happened	2
later	2
to	5
discover	1
the	6
body	2
and	5
feel	2
repugnance	0
or	4
not	4
.	5

If	3
so	3
,	5
then	3
it	4
is	4
clear	2
that	4
in	5
saying	2
the	6
suffering	2
was	4
bad	2
we	3
are	4
not	4
expressing	1
our	3
feelings	1
only	3
.	5

We	3
are	4
saying	2
that	4
the	6
pain	2
was	4
bad	2
when	3
and	5
as	4
it	4
occurred	2
and	5
before	3
anyone	2
took	2
an	4
attitude	2
toward	2
it	4
.	5

The	4
first	3
argument	2
is	4
thus	2
an	4
ideal	1
experiment	2
in	5
which	4
we	3
use	3
the	6
method	2
of	5
difference	2
.	5

It	3
removes	0
our	3
present	2
expression	2
and	5
shows	1
that	4
the	6
badness	1
we	3
meant	1
would	4
not	4
be	4
affected	1
by	4
this	4
,	5
whereas	1
on	4
positivist	1
grounds	1
it	4
should	3
be	4
.	5

The	4
second	2
argument	2
applies	1
the	6
method	2
in	5
the	6
reverse	0
way	3
.	5

It	3
ideally	0
removes	0
the	6
past	2
event	2
,	5
and	5
shows	1
that	4
this	4
would	4
render	0
false	1
what	3
we	3
mean	2
to	5
say	3
,	5
whereas	1
on	4
positivist	1
grounds	1
it	4
should	3
not	4
.	5

Let	2
us	3
suppose	1
that	4
the	6
animal	1
did	3
not	4
in	5
fact	2
fall	2
into	3
the	6
trap	1
and	5
did	3
not	4
suffer	1
at	4
all	4
,	5
but	4
that	4
we	3
mistakenly	0
believe	2
it	4
did	3
,	5
and	5
say	3
as	4
before	3
that	4
its	3
suffering	2
was	4
an	4
evil	1
thing	2
.	5

On	2
the	6
positivist	1
theory	2
,	5
everything	2
I	4
sought	1
to	5
express	1
by	4
calling	1
it	4
evil	1
in	5
the	6
first	3
case	2
is	4
still	3
present	2
in	5
the	6
second	2
.	5

In	3
the	6
only	3
sense	2
in	5
which	4
badness	1
is	4
involved	2
at	4
all	4
,	5
whatever	1
was	4
bad	2
in	5
the	6
first	3
case	2
is	4
still	3
present	2
in	5
its	3
entirety	0
,	5
since	3
all	4
that	4
is	4
expressed	1
in	5
either	2
case	2
is	4
a	5
state	2
of	5
feeling	2
,	5
and	5
that	4
feeling	2
is	4
still	3
there	3
.	5

And	3
our	3
question	2
is	4
,	5
is	4
such	3
an	4
implication	0
consistent	1
with	4
what	3
we	3
meant	1
?	4

Clearly	0
it	4
is	4
not	4
.	5

If	3
anyone	2
asked	2
us	3
,	5
after	3
we	3
made	3
the	6
remark	1
that	4
the	6
suffering	2
was	4
a	5
bad	2
thing	2
,	5
whether	2
we	3
should	3
think	2
it	4
relevant	1
to	5
what	3
we	3
said	3
to	5
learn	1
that	4
the	6
incident	1
had	4
never	3
occurred	2
and	5
no	3
pain	2
had	4
been	4
suffered	1
at	4
all	4
,	5
we	3
should	3
say	3
that	4
it	4
made	3
all	4
the	6
difference	2
in	5
the	6
world	3
,	5
that	4
what	3
we	3
were	4
asserting	0
to	5
be	4
bad	2
was	4
precisely	1
the	6
suffering	2
we	3
thought	3
had	4
occurred	2
back	3
there	3
,	5
that	4
if	3
this	4
had	4
not	4
occurred	2
,	5
there	3
was	4
nothing	2
left	3
to	5
be	4
bad	2
,	5
and	5
that	4
our	3
assertion	0
was	4
in	5
that	4
case	2
mistaken	1
.	5

The	4
suggestion	1
that	4
in	5
saying	2
something	2
evil	1
had	4
occurred	2
we	3
were	4
after	3
all	4
making	2
no	3
mistake	1
,	5
because	3
we	3
had	4
never	3
meant	1
anyhow	0
to	5
say	3
anything	2
about	3
the	6
past	2
suffering	2
,	5
seems	2
to	5
me	3
merely	2
frivolous	0
.	5

If	3
we	3
did	3
not	4
mean	2
to	5
say	3
this	4
,	5
why	2
should	3
we	3
be	4
so	3
relieved	1
on	4
finding	1
that	4
the	6
suffering	2
had	4
not	4
occurred	2
?	4

On	2
the	6
theory	2
before	3
us	3
,	5
such	3
relief	1
would	4
be	4
groundless	0
,	5
for	4
in	5
that	4
suffering	2
itself	2
there	3
was	4
nothing	2
bad	2
at	4
all	4
,	5
and	5
hence	1
in	5
its	3
nonoccurrence	0
there	3
would	4
be	4
nothing	2
to	5
be	4
relieved	1
about	3
.	5

The	4
positivist	1
theory	2
would	4
here	3
distort	0
our	3
meaning	2
beyond	2
recognition	1
.	5

So	2
far	2
as	4
I	4
can	3
see	3
,	5
there	3
is	4
only	3
one	4
way	3
out	3
for	4
the	6
positivist	1
.	5

He	4
holds	1
that	4
goodness	1
and	5
badness	1
lie	2
in	5
feelings	1
of	5
approval	1
or	4
disapproval	1
.	5

And	3
there	3
is	4
a	5
way	3
in	5
which	4
he	4
might	3
hold	2
that	4
badness	1
did	3
in	5
this	4
case	2
precede	0
our	3
own	3
feeling	2
of	5
disapproval	1
without	2
belonging	1
to	5
the	6
pain	2
itself	2
.	5

The	4
pain	2
in	5
itself	2
was	4
neutral	1
;	4
but	4
unfortunately	0
the	6
rabbit	1
,	5
on	4
no	3
grounds	1
at	4
all	4
,	5
took	2
up	3
toward	2
this	4
neutral	1
object	2
an	4
attitude	2
of	5
disapproval	1
and	5
that	4
made	3
it	4
for	4
the	6
first	3
time	3
,	5
and	5
in	5
the	6
only	3
intelligible	0
sense	2
,	5
bad	2
.	5

This	3
way	3
of	5
escape	1
is	4
theoretically	0
possible	2
,	5
but	4
since	3
it	4
has	3
grave	1
difficulties	1
of	5
its	3
own	3
and	5
has	3
not	4
,	5
so	3
far	2
as	4
I	4
know	3
,	5
been	4
urged	1
by	4
positivists	0
,	5
it	4
is	4
perhaps	2
best	2
not	4
to	5
spend	1
time	3
over	3
it	4
.	5

I	4
come	3
now	3
to	5
a	5
third	2
argument	2
,	5
which	4
again	3
is	4
very	3
simple	2
.	5

When	3
we	3
come	3
upon	2
the	6
rabbit	1
and	5
make	3
our	3
remark	1
about	3
its	3
suffering	2
being	3
a	5
bad	2
thing	2
,	5
we	3
presumably	1
make	3
it	4
with	4
some	3
feeling	2
;	4
the	6
positivists	0
are	4
plainly	1
right	3
in	5
saying	2
that	4
such	3
remarks	1
do	3
usually	2
express	1
feeling	2
.	5

But	3
suppose	1
that	4
a	5
week	2
later	2
we	3
revert	0
to	5
the	6
incident	1
in	5
thought	3
and	5
make	3
our	3
statement	2
again	3
.	5

And	3
suppose	1
that	4
the	6
circumstances	2
have	4
now	3
so	3
changed	1
that	4
the	6
feeling	2
with	4
which	4
we	3
made	3
the	6
remark	1
in	5
the	6
first	3
place	3
has	3
faded	1
.	5

The	4
pathetic	0
evidence	2
is	4
no	3
longer	2
before	3
us	3
;	4
and	5
we	3
are	4
now	3
so	3
fatigued	0
in	5
body	2
and	5
mind	2
that	4
feeling	2
is	4
,	5
as	4
we	3
say	3
,	5
quite	2
dead	2
.	5

In	3
these	3
circumstances	2
,	5
since	3
what	3
was	4
expressed	1
by	4
the	6
remark	1
when	3
first	3
made	3
is	4
,	5
on	4
the	6
theory	2
before	3
us	3
,	5

was	4
a	5
bad	2
thing	2

the	6

at	4

if	3

We	3

I	4
come	3
now	3
to	5
a	5
fourth	2
consideration	1
.	5

We	3
all	4
believe	2
that	4
toward	2
acts	1
or	4
effects	2
of	5
a	5
certain	2
kind	2
one	4
attitude	2
is	4
fitting	1
and	5
another	3
not	4
;	4
but	4
on	4
the	6
theory	2
before	3
us	3
such	3
a	5
belief	1
would	4
not	4
make	3
sense	2
.	5

Broad	0
and	5
Ross	0
have	4
lately	0
contended	0
that	4
this	4
fitness	0
is	4
one	4
of	5
the	6
main	2
facts	1
of	5
ethics	0
,	5
and	5
I	4
suspect	1
they	4
are	4
right	3
.	5

But	3
that	4
is	4
not	4
exactly	2
my	3
point	2
.	5

My	2
point	2
is	4
this	4
:	3

whether	2
there	3
is	4
such	3
fitness	0
or	4
not	4
,	5
we	3
all	4
assume	1
that	4
there	3
is	4
,	5
and	5
if	3
we	3
do	3
,	5
we	3
express	1
in	5
moral	2
judgments	1
more	3
than	3
the	6
subjectivists	0
say	3
we	3
do	3
.	5

Let	2
me	3
illustrate	1
.	5

In	3
his	4
novel	1
The	4
House	2
of	5
the	6
Dead	0
,	5
Dostoevsky	0
tells	1
of	5
his	4
experiences	1
in	5
a	5
Siberian	0
prison	1
camp	2
.	5

Whatever	1
the	6
unhappy	1
inmates	0
of	5
such	3
camps	1
are	4
like	3
today	2
,	5
Dostoevsky	0
's	4
companions	0
were	4
about	3
as	4
grim	0
a	5
lot	2
as	4
can	3
be	4
imagined	1
.	5

``	4
I	4
have	4
heard	2
stories	1
''	4
,	5
he	4
writes	1

``	4

''	4
.	5

Most	2
of	5
us	3
would	4
say	3
that	4
in	5
this	4
delight	1
at	4
the	6
killing	1
of	5
others	2
or	4
the	6
causing	1
of	5
suffering	2
there	3
is	4
something	2
very	3
unfitting	0
.	5

If	3
we	3
were	4
asked	2
why	2
we	3
thought	3
so	3
,	5
we	3
should	3
say	3
that	4
these	3
things	2
involve	1
great	3
evil	1
and	5
are	4
wrong	1
,	5
and	5
that	4
to	5
take	3
delight	1
in	5
what	3
is	4
evil	1
or	4
wrong	1
is	4
plainly	1
unfitting	0
.	5

Now	2
on	4
the	6
subjectivist	0
view	2
,	5
this	4
answer	2
is	4
ruled	1
out	3
.	5

For	3
before	3
someone	1
takes	2
up	3
an	4
attitude	2
toward	2
death	2
,	5
suffering	2
,	5
or	4
their	4
infliction	0
,	5
they	4
have	4
no	3
moral	2
quality	2
at	4
all	4
.	5

There	3
is	4
therefore	2
nothing	2
about	3
them	3
to	5
which	4
an	4
attitude	2
of	5
approval	1
or	4
condemnation	1
could	3
be	4
fitting	1
.	5

They	3
are	4
in	5
themselves	2
neutral	1
,	5
and	5
,	5
so	3
far	2
as	4
they	4
get	3
a	5
moral	2
quality	2
,	5
they	4
get	3
it	4
only	3
through	3
being	3
invested	0
with	4
it	4
by	4
the	6
attitude	2
of	5
the	6
onlooker	0
.	5

But	3
if	3
that	4
is	4
true	2
,	5
why	2
is	4
any	3
attitude	2
more	3
fitting	1
than	3
any	3
other	3
?	4

Would	1
applause	1
,	5
for	4
example	2
,	5
be	4
fitting	1
if	3
,	5
apart	1
from	4
the	6
applause	1
,	5
there	3
were	4
nothing	2
good	3
to	5
applaud	0
?	4

Would	1
condemnation	1
be	4
fitting	1
if	3
,	5
independently	0
of	5
the	6
condemnation	1
,	5
there	3
were	4
nothing	2
bad	2
to	5
condemn	0
?	4

In	3
such	3
a	5
case	2
,	5
any	3
attitude	2
would	4
be	4
as	4
fitting	1
or	4
unfitting	0
as	4
any	3
other	3
,	5
which	4
means	2
that	4
the	6
notion	1
of	5
fitness	0
has	3
lost	2
all	4
point	2
.	5

Indeed	1
we	3
are	4
forced	2
to	5
go	3
much	3
farther	1
.	5

If	3
goodness	1
and	5
badness	1
lie	2
in	5
attitudes	1
only	3
and	5
hence	1
are	4
brought	2
into	3

by	4

,	5
those	3
men	3
who	3
greeted	1
death	2

misery	1
with	4
childishly	0

are	4
taking	2
the	6
only	3
sensible	0
line	2

If	3
there	3
is	4
nothing	2
evil	1
in	5
these	3
things	2
,	5
if	3
they	4
get	3
their	4
moral	2
complexion	0
only	3
from	4
our	3
feeling	2
about	3
them	3
,	5
why	2
should	3
n't	3
they	4
be	4
greeted	1
with	4

To	2
greet	0
them	3

repulsion	0
would	4
turn	2
what	3
before	3

something	2

and	5
even	3
on	4
subjectivist	0
assumptions	1

On	2
the	6

But	3
before	3

we	3

first	3
find	2
answers	1

then	3
we	3

provide	2
something	2

a	5
complete	2
answer	2

the	6
question	2

In	3
what	3
ways	1
,	5
then	3
,	5
did	3
the	6
patient	2
's	4
psychical	0
blindness	1
manifest	0
itself	2

He	4

The	4
meaning	2
of	5
this	4
,	5
as	4
we	3
shall	2
see	3

is	4
that	4
he	4
had	4
no	3
fund	0
of	5
visual	2
memory-images	0

objects	2
as	4

and	5
,	5
therefore	2

he	4
could	3
not	4
recognize	1
even	3
long-familiar	0
things	2
upon	2
seeing	1
them	3
again	3
.	5

Instead	1
,	5
he	4
constantly	1
became	2
lost	2
in	5
parts	2
and	5
components	1
of	5
them	3
,	5
confused	1
some	3
of	5

so	3
on	4

unless	1
he	4
allowed	2
time	3
to	5
``	4

question	2
through	3

and	5
in	5
this	4

discover	1
its	3

According	1
to	5
his	4
own	3
testimony	1
,	5
he	4
never	3
actually	2
saw	2
things	2
as	4
shaped	1
but	4
only	3
as	4
generally	2
amorphous	0
``	4

a	5
more	3

size	2
;	4
at	4
their	4
edges	1
they	4
slipped	1
pretty	2
much	3
out	3
of	5
focus	1
altogether	1
.	5

But	3
by	4
the	6
tracing	1
procedure	1
,	5
he	4
could	3
,	5
in	5
a	5
strange	1
obviously	1
kinesthetic	0
manner	2
,	5
find	2

unseen	0

an	4
organized	1
whole	2
and	5
then	3
recognize	1
it	4
as	4
a	5
man	3
or	4
a	5
triangle	0
or	4
whatever	1
it	4
turned	2
out	3
to	5
be	4

If	3
,	5
however	2
,	5
the	6
figure	2
to	5
be	4
discerned	0
were	4
complicated	1
,	5
composed	1
of	5
several	2
interlocking	0
subfigures	0

so	3
on	4

even	3
the	6

process	2
failed	1
him	4

and	5
he	4
could	3
not	4
focus	1
even	3
relatively	2
simple	2

among	2
its	3
parts	2

This	3
meant	1
,	5
concretely	0
,	5
that	4
the	6
patient	2
could	3
not	4
read	2
at	4
all	4
without	2
making	2
writing	2

movements	1

the	6
head	3

thus	2
confused	1
the	6

one	4
only	3
by	4
tracing	1
it	4

The	4
patient	2
himself	3
denied	1
that	4
he	4
had	4
any	3

imagery	0
at	4
all	4
;	4
and	5
there	3
was	4
ample	1
evidence	2
of	5
the	6
following	2
sort	2
to	5
corroborate	0
him	4
.	5

After	2
a	5
conversation	1
with	4
another	3
man	3
,	5
he	4
was	4
able	2
to	5
recount	0
practically	1
everything	2
that	4
had	4
been	4
said	3
but	4
could	3
not	4
describe	1
at	4
all	4
what	3
the	6
other	3
man	3
looked	2
like	3

Nor	1
could	3
he	4
call	2
up	3
memory-pictures	0
of	5
close	2
friends	1
or	4
relatives	1
.	5

In	3
short	2
,	5
both	3
his	4
own	3
declarations	0
and	5
his	4
figural	0
blindness	1
,	5
when	3
he	4
looked	2
at	4
objects	2
,	5
seem	2
to	5
present	2
undeniable	0
evidence	2
that	4
he	4
had	4
simply	2
no	3
visual	2
memory	2
at	4
all	4
.	5

He	4
was	4
oblivious	0
of	5
the	6
form	2
of	5
the	6
object	2
actually	2
being	3
viewed	1
,	5
precisely	1
because	3
he	4
could	3
not	4
assign	1
it	4
to	5
a	5
visual	2
shape	2
,	5
already	2
learned	2
and	5
held	2
in	5
visual	2
memory	2
,	5
as	4
persons	1
of	5
normal	2
vision	1
do	3
.	5

He	4
could	3
not	4
recognize	1
it	4
;	4
he	4
was	4
absolutely	1
unfamiliar	0
with	4
it	4
because	3
he	4
had	4
no	3
visual	2
memory	2
at	4
all	4
.	5

Therefore	1
,	5
his	4
only	3
recourse	0
was	4
to	5
learn	1
the	6
shape	2
all	4
over	3
again	3
for	4
each	3
new	3
visual	2
experience	2
of	5
the	6
same	3
individual	2
object	2
or	4
type	2
of	5
object	2
;	4
and	5
this	4
he	4
could	3
do	3
only	3
by	4
going	2
over	3
its	3
mass	2
with	4
the	6
tracing	1
procedure	1
.	5

Then	2
he	4
might	3
finally	2
recognize	1
it	4
,	5
apparently	2
by	4
combining	0
the	6
visual	2
blot	1
,	5
actually	2
being	3
seen	2

with	4
tactual	1
feelings	1
in	5
the	6
head	3

body	2
accompanying	0
the	6
tracing	1
movements	1
.	5

This	3
would	4
mean	2
,	5
it	4
can	3
readily	1
be	4
seen	2
,	5
that	4
,	5
again	3
,	5
for	4
each	3
new	3
visual	2
experience	2
the	6
tracing	1
motions	1
would	4
have	4
to	5
be	4
repeated	1
because	3
of	5
the	6
absence	2
of	5
visual	2
imagery	0

As	3
one	4
would	4
surmise	0
,	5
the	6
procedure	1

be	4
repeated	1

with	4
the	6

enough	2

which	4
the	6

their	4

With	2
respect	2

points	2
are	4
worth	1
making	2

First	2
,	5
it	4

be	4

on	4
the	6
fact	2
that	4
on	4
its	3

``	4
festivus	0

gay	1

fact	2

it	4

``	4

not	4
gay	1

frivolous	0

and	5
the	6
opposite	1
of	5
gay	1
is	4
not	4
serious	2

.	5

More	2
believed	1
that	4
a	5
man	3
could	3

and	5
gay	1

That	3
a	5
writer	1

a	5
common	2
professional	2

that	4
their	4

they	4

The	4

called	2

asked	2
if	3

uneasy	1
about	3

He	4
did	3
not	4

appear	2

It	3
did	3

Therefore	1

he	4
decided	2

think	2
much	3
of	5
the	6
new	3
pastor	1
,	5
and	5
what	3
the	6
new	3
pastor	1
thought	3
of	5
the	6
audience	2
he	4
did	3
not	4
dare	1
at	4
the	6
time	3
to	5
say	3
.	5

During	2
the	6
next	2
weeks	2
he	4
looked	2
over	3
the	6
situation	2
.	5

First	2
of	5
all	4
there	3
was	4
the	6
parsonage	0
,	5
an	4
utterly	0
impossible	1
place	3
for	4
civilized	0
people	3
to	5
live	2
in	5
,	5
originally	0
poorly	1
conceived	1
,	5
apparently	2
not	4
repaired	1
for	4
years	3
,	5
with	4
no	3
plumbing	0
or	4
sewage	2
,	5
with	4
rat-holes	0
and	5
rot	1
.	5

It	3
was	4
arranged	1
that	4
he	4
would	4
board	1
in	5
the	6
home	3
of	5
one	4
of	5
the	6
old	3
members	2
of	5
the	6
church	2
,	5
a	5
woman	2
named	1
Catt	0
who	3
,	5
as	4
Wilson	2
afterward	1
found	3
,	5
was	4
briefly	1
referred	1
to	5
as	4
The	4
Cat	0
because	3
of	5
her	3
sharp	2
tongue	1
and	5
fierce	0
initiative	0
.	5

Ann	0
Catt	0
was	4
a	5
lonely	1
,	5
devoted	1
soul	1
,	5
never	3
married	2
,	5
conducting	0
a	5
spotless	0
home	3
and	5
devoted	1
to	5
her	3
church	2
,	5
but	4
a	5
perpetual	0
dissenter	0
and	5
born	2
critic	0
.	5

She	3
soared	0
over	3
the	6
new	3
pastor	1
like	3
an	4
avenging	0
angel	0
lest	1
he	4
stray	0
from	4
the	6
path	1
and	5
not	4
know	3
all	4
the	6
truth	1
and	5
gossip	0
of	5
which	4
she	3
was	4
chief	1
repository	0
.	5

Then	2
Wilson	2
looked	2
over	3
the	6
church	2
and	5
studied	2
its	3
condition	2
.	5

The	4
salary	1
of	5
the	6
pastor	1
had	4
for	4
years	3
been	4
$	2
500	1
annually	0
and	5
even	3
this	4
was	4
in	5
arrears	0
.	5

Wilson	2
made	3
up	3
his	4
mind	2
that	4
he	4
must	3
receive	1
at	4
least	2
$	2
2500	0
,	5
but	4
when	3
he	4
mentioned	1
this	4
to	5
the	6
Deacons	0
they	4
said	3
nothing	2
.	5

The	4
church	2
itself	2
must	3
be	4
repaired	1
.	5

It	3
was	4
dirty	1
and	5
neglected	0
.	5

It	3
really	2
ought	1
to	5
be	4
rebuilt	0
,	5
and	5
he	4
determined	2
to	5
go	3
up	3
and	5
talk	2
to	5
the	6
city	2
banks	1
about	3
this	4
.	5

Meanwhile	1
,	5
the	6
city	2
itself	2
should	3
be	4
talked	1
to	5
.	5

The	4
streets	1
in	5
the	6
colored	1
section	1
were	4
dirty	1
.	5

There	3
was	4
typhoid	0
and	5
malaria	0
.	5

The	4
children	2
had	4
nowhere	1
to	5
go	3
and	5
no	3
place	3
to	5
play	2
,	5
not	4
even	3
sidewalks	0
.	5

The	4
school	2
was	4
small	3
,	5
dark	2
and	5
ill-equipped	0
.	5

The	4
teacher	2
was	4
a	5
pliant	0
fool	1
.	5

There	3
were	4
two	3
liquor	1
saloons	0
not	4
very	3
far	2
from	4
the	6
church	2
,	5
one	4
white	2
,	5
that	4
is	4
conducted	1
for	4
white	2
people	3
with	4
a	5
side	2
entrance	1
for	4
Negroes	1
;	4
the	6
other	3
exclusively	0
Negro	1
.	5

Undoubtedly	0
,	5
there	3
was	4
a	5
good	3
deal	2
of	5
gambling	1
in	5
both	3
.	5

On	2
the	6
other	3
side	2
of	5
the	6
church	2
was	4
a	5
quiet	1
,	5
well-kept	0
house	2
with	4
shutters	1
and	5
recently	2
painted	1
.	5

Wilson	2
inquired	1
about	3
it	4
.	5

It	3
was	4
called	2
Kent	1
House	2
.	5

The	4
deacon	0
of	5
the	6
church	2
,	5
Carlson	0
,	5
was	4
its	3
janitor	0

One	2
of	5
the	6
leading	1
members	2
of	5
the	6
Amen	1
corner	2
was	4
cook	1
;	4
there	3
were	4
two	3
or	4
three	3
colored	1
maids	0
employed	1
there	3
.	5

Wilson	2
was	4
told	2
that	4
it	4
was	4
a	5
sort	2
of	5
hotel	1
for	4
white	2
people	3
,	5
which	4
seemed	2
to	5
him	4
rather	2
queer	0
.	5

Why	2
should	3
a	5
white	2
hotel	1
be	4
set	2
down	3
in	5
the	6
center	2
of	5
Black	1
Bottom	1
?	4

But	3
nevertheless	1
it	4
looked	2
respectable	1
.	5

He	4
was	4
glad	1
to	5
have	4
it	4
there	3
.	5

The	4
rest	2
of	5
Black	1
Bottom	1
was	4
a	5
rabbit	1
warren	0
of	5
homes	1
in	5
every	3
condition	2

with	4

The	4

not	4

from	4
the	6
worst	1
and	5
the	6
worst	1
nestled	0
cosily	0
beside	1
the	6
better	2

The	4
yards	1

front	2
and	5
back	3

were	4
narrow	1
;	4
some	3
were	4

After	2
looking	2
about	3
a	5
bit	2
,	5
Wilson	2
discovered	1
beyond	2
Black	1
Bottom	1
,	5
across	2
the	6
river	2
and	5
far	2
removed	2
from	4
the	6
white	2
city	2
,	5
a	5
considerable	1
tract	1
of	5
land	2
,	5
and	5
it	4
occurred	2
to	5
him	4
that	4
the	6
church	2
and	5
the	6
better	2
Negro	1
homes	1
might	3
gradually	1
be	4
moved	2
to	5
this	4
plot	1
.	5

He	4
talked	1
about	3
it	4
to	5
the	6
Presiding	0
Elder	0
.	5

The	4
Presiding	0
Elder	0
looked	2
him	4
over	3
rather	2
carefully	2
.	5

He	4
was	4
not	4
sure	2
what	3
kind	2
of	5
a	5
man	3
he	4
had	4
in	5
hand	2
.	5

But	3
there	3
was	4
one	4
thing	2
that	4
he	4
had	4
to	5
stress	1
,	5
and	5
that	4
was	4
that	4
the	6
contribution	1
to	5
the	6
general	2
church	2
expenses	0
,	5
the	6
dollar	1
money	2
,	5
had	4
been	4
seriously	1
falling	1
behind	2
in	5
this	4
church	2
,	5
and	5
that	4
must	3
be	4
looked	2
after	3
immediately	2
.	5

In	3
fact	2
,	5
he	4
intimated	0
clearly	2
that	4
that	4
was	4
the	6
reason	2
that	4
Wilson	2
had	4
been	4
sent	2
here	3
-	4
to	5
make	3
a	5
larger	2
contribution	1
of	5
dollar	1
money	2
.	5

Wilson	2
stressed	1
the	6
fact	2
that	4
clear	2
as	4
this	4
was	4
,	5
they	4
must	3
have	4
a	5
better	2
church	2
,	5
a	5
more	3
business-like	0
conduct	1
of	5
the	6
church	2
organization	1
,	5
and	5
an	4
effort	2
to	5
get	3
this	4
religious	2
center	2
out	3
of	5
its	3
rut	0
of	5
wild	1
worship	1
into	3
a	5
modern	2
church	2
organization	1
.	5

He	4
emphasized	1
to	5
the	6
Presiding	0
Elder	0
the	6
plan	2
of	5
giving	1
up	3
the	6
old	3
church	2
and	5
moving	2
across	2
the	6
river	2
.	5

The	4
Presiding	0
Elder	0
was	4
sure	2
that	4
that	4
would	4
be	4
impossible	1
.	5

But	3
he	4
told	2
Wilson	2
to	5
``	4
go	3
ahead	1
and	5
try	2
''	4
.	5

And	3
Wilson	2
tried	2
.	5

It	3
did	3
seem	2
impossible	1
.	5

The	4
bank	1
which	4
held	2
the	6
mortgage	0
on	4
the	6
old	3
church	2
declared	1
that	4
the	6
interest	2
was	4
considerably	1
in	5
arrears	0
,	5
and	5
the	6
real	2
estate	1
people	3
said	3
flatly	0
that	4
the	6
land	2
across	2
the	6
river	2
was	4
being	3
held	2
for	4
an	4
eventual	0
development	2
for	4
white	2
working	2
people	3
who	3
were	4
coming	2
in	5
,	5
and	5
that	4
none	1
would	4
be	4
sold	1
to	5
colored	1
folk	1
.	5

When	3
it	4
was	4
proposed	1
to	5
rebuild	0
the	6
church	2
,	5
Wilson	2
found	3
that	4
the	6
terms	2
for	4
a	5
new	3
mortgage	0
were	4
very	3
high	3
.	5

He	4
was	4
sure	2
that	4
he	4
could	3
do	3
better	2
if	3
he	4
went	3
to	5
Atlanta	1
to	5
get	3
the	6
deal	2
financed	0
.	5

But	3
when	3
this	4
proposal	1
was	4
made	3
to	5
his	4
Deacon	0
Board	1
,	5
he	4
met	1
unanimous	0
opposition	1
.	5

The	4
church	2
certainly	2
would	4
not	4
be	4
removed	2
.	5

The	4
very	3
proposition	0
was	4
sacrilege	0
.	5

It	3
had	4
been	4
here	3
fifty	1
years	3
.	5

It	3
was	4
going	2
to	5
stay	1
forever	1
.	5

It	3
was	4
hardly	2
possible	2
to	5
get	3
any	3
argument	2
on	4
the	6
subject	2
.	5

As	3
for	4
rebuilding	0
,	5
well	3
,	5
that	4
might	3
be	4
looked	2
into	3
,	5
but	4
there	3
was	4
no	3
hurry	1
,	5
no	3
hurry	1
at	4
all	4

Wilson	2
again	3
went	3
downtown	1
to	5
a	5
different	2
banker	0
,	5
an	4
intelligent	1
young	2
white	2
man	3
who	3
seemed	2
rather	2
sympathetic	1
,	5
but	4
he	4
shook	1
his	4
head	3
.	5

``	4
Reverend	1
''	4
,	5
he	4
said	3
,	5
``	4
I	4
think	2
you	4
do	3
n't	3
quite	2

the	6

n't	3
you	4
see	3
the	6

I	4

The	4

other	3

they	4

When	3

Now	2

would	4
just	3

the	6

it	4
would	4
last	3
for	4
five	2

ten	2
years	3

By	2
that	4
time	3

perhaps	2
something	2
better	2
can	3
be	4
done	2
''	4

Then	2
Wilson	2
asked	2

``	4

The	4

at	4
him	4

a	5
certain	2

then	3
he	4

And	3
he	4
dismissed	0

``	4

Wilson	2

he	4
was	4
absolutely	1

This	3

of	5

the	6
sort	2

putting	1

carrying	1
them	3

But	3
it	4
had	4
largely	1
disappeared	1
on	4
account	2

the	6
whites	0

through	3
growing	2
resentment	1

the	6
part	3

the	6
Negroes	1
as	4
they	4
became	2
more	3

better	2

But	3
this	4
situation	2
of	5
Kent	1

was	4
more	3
subtle	1

The	4
wages	1

larger	2

The	4

Wilson	2

that	4

And	3
for	4
him	4

without	2

After	2
some	3

he	4
came	3
to	5
an	4

An	2

was	4

The	4

The	4
rider	1
from	4
Concord	0
was	4
as	4
good	3
as	4
his	4
word	2
.	5

He	4
came	3
spurring	0
and	5
whooping	0
down	3
the	6
road	2
,	5
his	4
horse	2
kicking	1
up	3
clouds	1
of	5
dust	2
,	5
shouting	1
:	3

``	4
They	3
're	2
a-coming	0
!	3

By	2
God	2
,	5
they	4
're	2
a-coming	0
,	5
they	4
are	4
''	4
!	3

We	3
heard	2
him	4
before	3
he	4
ever	2
showed	2
,	5
and	5
we	3
heard	2
him	4
yelling	0
after	3
he	4
was	4
out	3
of	5
sight	1

Solomon	0
Chandler	1
had	4
n't	3
misjudged	0
the	6
strength	2
of	5
his	4
lungs	1
,	5
not	4
at	4
all	4
.	5

I	4
think	2
you	4
could	3
have	4
heard	2
him	4
a	5
mile	1
away	3
,	5
and	5
he	4
was	4
bursting	1
at	4
every	3
seam	0
with	4
importance	2
.	5

I	4
have	4
observed	2
that	4
being	3
up	3
on	4
a	5
horse	2
changes	2
the	6
whole	2
character	2
of	5
a	5
man	3
,	5
and	5
when	3
a	5
very	3
small	3
man	3
is	4
up	3
on	4
a	5
saddle	1
,	5
he	4
'd	2
like	3
as	4
not	4
prefer	1
to	5
eat	1
his	4
meals	1
there	3
.	5

That	3
's	4
understandable	1
,	5
and	5
I	4
appreciate	1
the	6
sentiment	1
.	5

As	3
for	4
this	4
rider	1
,	5
I	4
never	3
saw	2
him	4
before	3
or	4
afterwards	0
and	5
never	3
saw	2
him	4
dismounted	0
,	5
so	3
whether	2
he	4
stood	2
tall	1
or	4
short	2
in	5
his	4
shoes	1
,	5
I	4
can	3
n't	3
say	3
;	4
but	4
I	4
do	3
know	3
that	4
he	4
gave	2
the	6
day	3
tone	1
and	5
distinction	1
.	5

The	4
last	3
thing	2
in	5
the	6
world	3
that	4
resembled	0
a	5
war	2
was	4
our	3
line	2
of	5
farmers	1
and	5
storekeepers	0
and	5
mechanics	1
perched	0
on	4
top	2
of	5
a	5
stone	1
wall	2
,	5
and	5
this	4
dashing	0
rider	1
made	3
us	3
feel	2
a	5
good	3
deal	2
sharper	0
and	5
more	3
alert	1
to	5
the	6
situation	2
.	5

We	3
came	3
down	3
off	3
the	6
wall	2
as	4
if	3
he	4
had	4
toppled	0
all	4
of	5
us	3
,	5
and	5
we	3
crouched	1
behind	2
it	4
.	5

I	4
have	4
heard	2
people	3
talk	2
with	4
contempt	0
about	3
the	6
British	1
regulars	0
,	5
but	4
that	4
only	3
proves	1
that	4
a	5
lot	2
of	5
people	3
talk	2
about	3
things	2
of	5
which	4
they	4
are	4
deplorably	0
ignorant	1
.	5

Whatever	1
we	3
felt	2
about	3
the	6
redcoats	1
,	5
we	3
respected	1
them	3
in	5
terms	2
of	5
their	4
trade	2
,	5
which	4
was	4
killing	1
;	4
and	5
I	4
know	3
that	4
I	4
,	5
myself	2
,	5
was	4
nauseated	0
with	4
apprehension	0
and	5
fear	2
and	5
that	4
my	3
hands	2
were	4
soaking	0
wet	1
where	3
they	4
held	2
my	3
gun	1
.	5

I	4
wanted	2
to	5
wipe	0
my	3
flint	0
,	5
but	4
I	4
did	3
n't	3
dare	1
to	5
,	5
the	6
state	2
my	3
hands	2
were	4
in	5
,	5
just	3
as	4
I	4
did	3
n't	3
dare	1
to	5
do	3
anything	2
about	3
the	6
priming	0
.	5

The	4
gun	1
would	4
fire	2
or	4
not	4
,	5
just	3
as	4
chance	1
willed	0
.	5

I	4
put	2
a	5
lot	2
more	3
trust	1
in	5
my	3
two	3
legs	1
than	3
in	5
the	6
gun	1
,	5
because	3
the	6
most	3
important	2
thing	2
I	4
had	4
learned	2
about	3
war	2
was	4
that	4
you	4
could	3
run	2
away	3
and	5
survive	1
to	5
talk	2
about	3
it	4
.	5

The	4
gunfire	0
,	5
which	4
was	4
so	3
near	2
that	4
it	4
seemed	2
just	3
a	5
piece	2
up	3
the	6
road	2
now	3
,	5
stopped	2
for	4
long	3
enough	2
to	5
count	1
to	5
twenty	1
;	4
and	5
in	5
that	4
brief	1
interval	1
,	5
a	5
redcoat	1
officer	2
came	3
tearing	1
down	3
the	6
road	2
,	5
whipping	0
his	4
horse	2
fit	1
to	5
kill	1
.	5

I	4
do	3
n't	3
know	3
whether	2
he	4
was	4
after	3
our	3
rider	1
,	5
who	3
had	4
gone	2
by	4
a	5
minute	1
before	3
,	5
or	4
whether	2
he	4
was	4
simply	2
scouting	0
conditions	2
;	4
but	4
when	3
he	4
passed	2
us	3
by	4
,	5
a	5
musket	1
roared	1
,	5
and	5
he	4
reared	1
his	4
horse	2
,	5
swung	1
it	4
around	3

and	5
began	2
to	5
whip	1
it	4
back	3
in	5
the	6
direction	2
from	4
which	4
he	4
had	4
come	3

He	4
was	4
a	5
fine	2
and	5
showy	0
rider	1

but	4
his	4
skill	1
was	4
wasted	0
on	4
us	3

From	2
above	2
me	3
and	5
somewhere	1
behind	2
me	3

a	5
rifle	1
cracked	0

The	4
redcoat	1
officer	2
collapsed	0
like	3
a	5
punctured	0
bolster	0
,	5
and	5
the	6
horse	2
reared	1
and	5
threw	1
him	4
from	4

saddle	1

except	2
that	4
one	4
booted	0

caught	2
in	5

Half	1

by	4
the	6

the	6
dust	2

the	6
heat	2

the	6

leaped	0
our	3

out	3
the	6
rider	1

against	3
it	4

and	5
leaving	1
him	4
lying	1
there	3
among	2
us	3
-	4
while	3
the	6
horse	2
crashed	1
away	3
through	3
the	6
brush	1

It	3
was	4
my	3
initiation	0
to	5
war	2
and	5
the	6
insane	1
symphony	0
war	2
plays	2
;	4
for	4
what	3
had	4
happened	2
on	4
the	6

only	3
terror	1

broken	1

me	3

was	4
the	6
sharp	2
definition	1
of	5
what	3
my	3
reality	2
had	4
become	2
.	5

And	3
now	3
the	6
redcoats	1
were	4
coming	2

and	5
the	6
gunfire	0
was	4
a	5
part	3
of	5
the	6
dust	2
cloud	1
on	4
the	6
road	2
to	5
the	6
west	1
of	5
us	3

I	4
must	3
state	2
that	4
the	6
faster	1
things	2
happened	2
,	5
the	6
slower	1
they	4
happened	2
;	4
the	6
passage	1
and	5
rhythm	1
of	5
time	3

and	5
when	3
I	4
remember	2
back	3
to	5
what	3
happened	2
then	3
,	5
each	3
event	2
is	4
a	5
separate	1
and	5
frozen	1
incident	1
.	5

In	3
my	3
recollection	0
,	5
there	3
was	4
a	5
long	3
interval	1
between	3
the	6
death	2
of	5
the	6
officer	2
and	5
the	6
appearance	1
of	5
the	6
first	3
of	5
the	6
retreating	0
redcoats	1

and	5
in	5
that	4
interval	1
the	6
dust	2
cloud	1
over	3
the	6

hover	0

Yet	2
it	4
could	3
not	4

been	4

a	5
matter	2

then	3
the	6

My	2

he	4
rose	1
up	3

the	6
smell	1

gunpowder	0
that	4
came	3
floating	1
down	3

the	6

only	3
waiting	2

whatever	1
face	2
it	4

Now	2
the	6
face	2
was	4
his	4

He	4
wondered	1

he	4
made	3
that	4
gesture	1

on	4
his	4

He	4

it	4

But	3
there	3
was	4
no	3

out	3

It	3
was	4
nothing	2
to	5
him	4
if	3
rain	1

nobody	1
came	3

Then	2
why	2
was	4
he	4
assuming	1
the	6
role	2
-	4
the	6
gesture	1

the	6
suffering	2

What	3

was	4
he	4
now	3
taking	2
the	6

the	6

because	3
it	4

With	2

Adam	2

Adam	2
recognized	1

laughed	1

Looking	0
down	3
the	6

after	3
her	3

Adam	2
saw	2
that	4
she	3

again	3

again	3
removed	2
one	4

the	6
basket	1

He	4

Since	2

taken	2
only	3

he	4
had	4
had	4
no	3
experience	2

He	4
spent	1
concentrated	1
weeks	2
putting	1
his	4
two	3
figures	2
together	2
:	3
a	5
Mary	2
who	3
would	4
be	4
young	2

sensitive	1

yet	2
strong	2
enough	2
to	5
hold	2
her	3
son	2
on	4
her	3
lap	1
;	4
and	5
a	5
Jesus	1
who	3
,	5
though	2
lean	1
,	5
was	4
strong	2
even	3
in	5
death	2
-	4
a	5
look	2
he	4
remembered	1
well	3
from	4
his	4
experience	2
in	5
the	6
dead	2
room	2

He	4
drew	1
toward	2
the	6
composite	1

from	4
his	4
meticulously	0
accurate	1
memory	2
,	5
without	2
need	2
to	5
consult	0
his	4
sketches	1
.	5

Soon	1
he	4
was	4
ready	2
to	5
go	3
into	3
a	5
three-dimensional	1
figure	2
in	5
clay	1
.	5

Here	2
he	4
would	4
have	4
free	2
expression	2
because	3
the	6
material	2
could	3
be	4
moved	2
to	5
distort	0
forms	2

When	3
he	4
wanted	2
to	5
emphasize	1

or	4
get	3
greater	2
intensity	2
,	5
he	4
added	2

subtracted	0
clay	1

Next	1
he	4
turned	2
to	5
wax	1
because	3
there	3
was	4
a	5
similarity	0

wax	1
to	5
marble	1

quality	2

translucence	0

He	4
respected	1
each	3

these	3
approach	1
techniques	1

and	5
kept	2
them	3
in	5
character	2

smoothed	0
over	3

Yet	2
he	4
never	3

When	3
I	4
was	4
in	5

I	4
rode	1
him	4
pretty	2
hard	2
I	4
guess	1

Occasionally	1
if	3
I	4

Eileen	2

he	4

out	3

a	5

told	2

All	2

It	3
just	3

out	3

When	3
we	3

Pat	1

Before	1

Pat	1

to	5
it	4
that	4
I	4
was	4
fixed	2
up	3
with	4
a	5
job	2

Pat	1
had	4
contacts	1
all	4
over	3

A	3
friend	2

just	3
muscled	0
into	3

off	3

barges	0
who	3
acted	0

on	4
the	6
wharves	0

Most	2
of	5
them	3
were	4
elderly	1
men	3

It	3
was	4
responsible	1
and	5
sometimes	2
dangerous	1
work	3
because	3
the	6
thieving	0
is	4
awful	1
in	5

They	3

One	2
reason	2
the	6

take	3
them	3
over	3
was	4
to	5
get	3
the	6

Sposato	0
needed	2

With	2

one	4
truth	1

As	3

there	3
were	4
two	3
human	2
beings	1
working	2
together	2
on	4
the	6

project	1

there	3
would	4

you	4

no	3

No	2

he	4

never	3

that	4

All	2
of	5

be	4
equal	2
in	5

they	4

It	3
was	4
only	3

position	2

which	4

Even	2
Rector	2
himself	3

this	4
spirit	2

he	4
knew	2
it	4

not	4
for	4

early	2

for	4
the	6
one	4
clear	2
victory	2
he	4
had	4
talked	1
about	3
to	5
the	6
colonel	1

He	4
was	4
not	4
sure	2
how	3
much	3
of	5
this	4
desire	1
was	4
due	2
to	5
his	4
devotion	0

how	3

his	4

himself	3

too	3

But	3
perhaps	2
this	4
was	4
a	5
part	3
of	5
the	6
eternal	1
plan	2

that	4
man	3

ambition	0

He	4
sighed	1

How	2
foolish	0
it	4
was	4
to	5
try	2

fathom	0
the	6
truth	1
in	5
an	4
area	2
where	3
only	3
faith	1

suffice	0

He	4
would	4
have	4
to	5
work	3
without	2
questioning	0
the	6
motives	1
which	4
made	3
him	4
work	3

content	1
himself	3

however	2
it	4

would	4
be	4

His	3
first	3
move	2
was	4
to	5
send	1
Hino	1
to	5
the	6
village	1
to	5
spend	1
a	5
few	3
days	2
.	5

His	3
arm	2
had	4
been	4
giving	1
him	4
some	3
trouble	2
and	5
Rector	2
was	4
not	4
enough	2
of	5
a	5
medical	2
expert	1
to	5
determine	1
whether	2
it	4
had	4
healed	0
improperly	0

whether	2
Hino	1
was	4
simply	2
rebelling	0
against	3

tedious	0
work	3

print	0
shop	1

using	2
the	6
stiffness	0
in	5
his	4
arm	2
as	4
an	4
excuse	0

In	3
any	3
event	2
Rector	2
sent	2
him	4
to	5
the	6
local	2
hospital	1

have	4
it	4
checked	1

telling	1
him	4
to	5
keep	2
his	4
ears	1
open	2
while	3
he	4
was	4
in	5
the	6
village	1
to	5
see	3

he	4
could	3
find	2
out	3
what	3
Kayabashi	1
was	4

Hino	1

prospect	0

He	4
was	4
allowed	2
to	5
spend	1
his	4
nights	1
at	4
an	4
inn	0
near	2
the	6
hospital	1
and	5
he	4
was	4
given	2
some	3
extra	1
money	2
to	5
go	3
to	5
the	6
pachinko	0
parlor	1

an	4
excellent	1
place	3
to	5
make	3
contact	1
with	4

He	4
left	3
with	4
all	4
the	6
joyous	0
spirit	2
of	5
a	5
child	2
going	2
on	4
a	5
holiday	1

nodding	0

as	4
Rector	2
gave	2
him	4

final	2
instructions	0

He	4
was	4

he	4
was	4
simply	2
to	5
listen	1

report	2
back	3
what	3
he	4
heard	2

It	3
was	4

end	2
up	3

in	5
this	4

In	3
all	4

From	2

He	4
was	4
even	3

heard	2
what	3

a	5

relief	1

then	3
the	6
telephone	1
clicked	0
in	5

Rector	2
had	4
no	3
idea	2

Kayabashi	1

to	5
visit	2
the	6
mission	2

For	3
the	6
oyabun	0
to	5
make	3
such	3
a	5
trip	1

either	2
a	5
sign	1

an	4
indication	1
of	5
equally	1
great	3
confidence	1

and	5
from	4
all	4
the	6
available	2
information	2
it	4
was	4
probably	2
the	6
latter	2

Kayabashi	1
must	3
feel	2
fairly	1
certain	2
of	5
his	4
victory	2
in	5

to	5
make	3
a	5
visit	2
like	3
this	4

a	5
trip	1
which	4
could	3
be	4
so	3
easily	1
misinterpreted	0
by	4
the	6
people	3
in	5
the	6
village	1

At	2
the	6

time	3

it	4
was	4
unlikely	1
that	4
any	3
businessmen	1
would	4
spend	1
a	5
day	3
in	5
a	5
Christian	2
mission	2
out	3
of	5
mere	1
curiosity	1

No	2

Kayabashi	1
was	4
bringing	1
his	4

he	4
went	3
outside	2

Fujimoto	0

a	5
pile	1

Rector	2

He	4

He	4

And	3
she	3

him	4
again	3
there	3
in	5

standing	2

She	3

There	3

She	3

she	3
was	4

trying	2

But	3
he	4
did	3
not	4
notice	1

was	4
already	2
backing	0
the	6
car	1
down	3
to	5
the	6

saying	2
``	4
Toot-toot	0

She	3
stood	2
clutching	0

around	3
her	3
shoulders	1
until	2
he	4
had	4
swung	1
the	6
car	1
onto	1
the	6

Then	2
,	5
when	3
he	4
had	4
it	4
pointed	2
down	3
the	6
hill	1

he	4
stopped	2
to	5
gaze	1
at	4
her	3
through	3
the	6
window	2

She	3
had	4
begun	1
to	5
turn	2
back	3
toward	2
the	6
house	2

but	4
his	4
look	2
caught	2
her	3
and	5
she	3
stood	2
still	3

waiting	2
there	3
for	4
what	3
his	4
expression	2
indicated	2
would	4
be	4
a	5
serious	2
word	2

He	4
looked	2
at	4
her	3
out	3

himself	3

she	3
thought	3

as	4
he	4
did	3
only	3
for	4
an	4
instant	1
at	4
a	5
time	3
,	5
the	6
look	2
which	4
always	2
surprised	1
her	3
even	3
now	3
when	3
his	4
uncombable	0
hair	2
was	4
yellowing	0
a	5
little	3
and	5
his	4
breath	1
came	3
hard	2
through	3
his	4

the	6
look	2

on	4
a	5
Thursday	1
once	2

Now	2
she	3
kept	2
herself	2
protectively	0
ready	2
to	5
laugh	1
again	3
and	5
sure	2
enough	2
he	4
pointed	2
at	4
her	3
with	4
his	4
index	0
finger	1
and	5
said	3
``	4
Toot	0
''	4
!	3
once	2

and	5
roared	1
off	3
into	3
the	6
fog	1

surprising	1
him	4
with	4
the	6
suddenness	0

which	4
it	4
pressed	1
the	6

just	3
as	4
his	4
hand	2
did	3
when	3
he	4
worked	2

She	3
walked	2
back	3
to	5
the	6
house	2
and	5
entered	1

feeling	2
herself	2

sensing	0
some	3

of	5
opportunity	1
in	5
the	6

There	3
is	4
a	5
death	2
in	5
all	4

she	3
knew	2

promptly	1
put	2
it	4
out	3

She	3
enjoyed	1
great	3
parties	1

she	3

up	3

drinking	1
all	4

but	4
it	4
always	2

to	5
her	3
that	4

alone	2

alone	2
in	5
her	3
house	2

was	4

Now	2

and	5
finally	2

the	6
best	2

simply	2
sit	1

She	3

Every	1

Then	2
she	3
fell	2
asleep	1
again	3
as	4
suddenly	2
as	4
a	5
person	2
with	4
fever	1

and	5
when	3

it	4
was	4

She	3

yet	2

now	3
that	4
she	3

the	6

her	3

in	5
a	5

she	3

it	4

She	3

She	3

They	3

How	2

she	3

She	3
stood	2

rubbing	0

it	4

quite	2

But	3
they	4
all	4
said	3

``	4

for	4
dinner	1
and	5
sometimes	2
not	4
for	4
supper	1
.	5

When	3
they	4
first	3
married	2
he	4
had	4
been	4
working	2
in	5
the	6
fields	1
all	4
day	3
,	5
and	5
she	3
would	4
get	3
in	5
the	6
car	1
and	5
drive	2
to	5
wherever	1
he	4
was	4
working	2
,	5
to	5
take	3
him	4
a	5
fresh	1
hot	2
meal	1
.	5

Now	2
there	3
was	4
no	3
work	3
in	5
the	6
fields	1
,	5
nor	2
would	4
there	3
be	4
till	1
it	4
rained	0
,	5
and	5
she	3
did	3
not	4
know	3
where	3
he	4
went	3
.	5

Not	2
that	4
she	3
complained	1
,	5
or	4
had	4
any	3
cause	2
to	5
.	5

Four	1
or	4
five	2
of	5
the	6
cousins	0
from	4
East	1
Texas	2
were	4
about	3
his	4
age	2
,	5
so	3
naturally	1
they	4
ran	2
around	3
together	2
.	5

There	3
was	4
no	3
reason	2
for	4
her	3
to	5
ask	2
what	3
they	4
did	3
.	5

Thus	2
a	5
new	3
pattern	2
of	5
days	2
began	2
to	5
develop	1
,	5
for	4
Granny	0
Albright	1
did	3
not	4
die	2
.	5

She	3
lay	2
still	3
on	4
the	6
bed	2
,	5
her	3
head	3
hardly	2
denting	0
the	6
pillow	0
;	4
sometimes	2
she	3
opened	2
her	3
eyes	2
and	5
looked	2
around	3
,	5
and	5
sometimes	2
she	3
took	2
a	5
little	3
milk	1
or	4
soup	0
.	5

They	3
stopped	2
expecting	1
her	3
to	5
die	2
the	6
next	2
minute	1
,	5
but	4
only	3
in	5
the	6
next	2
day	3
or	4
two	3
.	5

Those	1
who	3
had	4
driven	1
hundreds	1
of	5
miles	2
for	4
the	6
burial	0
would	4
not	4
go	3
home	3
,	5
for	4
she	3
might	3
die	2
any	3
time	3
;	4
but	4
they	4
might	3
as	4
well	3
unpack	0
their	4
suitcases	0
,	5
for	4
she	3
might	3
linger	0
on	4
.	5

So	2
the	6
pattern	2
was	4
established	2
.	5

When	3
Linda	1
Kay	1
had	4
put	2
up	3
her	3
breakfast	1
dishes	1
and	5
mopped	0
her	3
linoleum	0
rugs	0
,	5
she	3
would	4
go	3
to	5
the	6
Big	1
House	2
.	5

There	3
was	4
not	4
anything	2
she	3
could	3
do	3
there	3
,	5
but	4
that	4
was	4
where	3
everyone	1
was	4
,	5
or	4
would	4
be	4
.	5

Bobby	1
Joe	2
and	5
the	6
boys	2
would	4
come	3
by	4
,	5
say	3
``	4
How	2
's	4
Granny	0
''	4
?	4
and	5
sit	1
on	4
the	6
porch	1
a	5
while	3
.	5

The	4
older	2
men	3
would	4
be	4
there	3
at	4
noon	1
,	5
and	5
maybe	1
rest	2
for	4
a	5
time	3
before	3
they	4
took	2
their	4
guns	1
off	3
to	5
the	6
creek	0
or	4
drove	1
down	3
the	6
road	2
towards	2
town	2

The	4
women	2
and	5
children	2
stayed	1
at	4
the	6
Albrights	0

The	4
women	2
,	5
keeping	1
their	4
voices	1
low	2
as	4
they	4
worked	2
around	3
the	6
house	2
or	4
sat	2
in	5
the	6
living	2
room	2
,	5
sounded	1
like	3
chickens	1
shut	1
up	3
in	5
a	5
coop	0
for	4
the	6
night	2
.	5

The	4
children	2
had	4
to	5
play	2
away	3
from	4
the	6
house	2
(	3
in	5
the	6
barn	1
loft	0
or	4
the	6

to	5
maintain	1
a	5
proper	1
quietness	0

Off	0
and	5
on	4
,	5
all	4
day	3

someone	1
would	4
be	4
wiping	0
at	4
the	6
powdery	0
gray	2
dust	2
that	4
settled	1
over	3
everything	2

The	4
evaporative	0

had	4
been	4
moved	2
to	5
Granny	0
's	4
room	2
,	5
and	5
her	3
door	2
was	4
kept	2
shut	1
;	4
so	3
that	4
the	6
rest	2
of	5
the	6
house	2
stayed	1
open	2
,	5
though	2
there	3
was	4
a	5
question	2
as	4
to	5
whether	2
it	4
was	4
hotter	0
or	4
cooler	0
that	4
way	3

The	4
dust	2
clogged	0
their	4
throats	0
,	5
and	5
the	6
heat	2
parched	0
them	3

so	3
that	4
the	6
women	2
were	4
always	2
making	2
ice	2

They	3
had	4
cleaned	1
up	3
an	4

ice	2
box	1
and	5
begun	1
to	5
buy	2
fifty	1
pound	1
blocks	1
of	5
ice	2
in	5
town	2

as	4

providing	1

Bobby	1

There	3
were	4
not	4

so	3
that	4
some	3
preferred	1

resting	1
their	4

Howard	1
,	5
who	3

took	2
the	6

it	4
seemed	2
at	4
once	2
that	4
Howard	1
sat	2

closer	1

Perhaps	2
it	4
was	4
just	3
that	4
he	4

that	4

so	3

my	3

all	4

``	4
You	3

We	3

Felix	2
took	2
us	3
into	3
his	4
studio	1

It	3
was	4
that	4
oddly	0
shaped	1
space	2
at	4
the	6
very	3
top	2

the	6
house	2

At	2
each	3

a	5

all	4

the	6

He	4
quickly	1

He	4
flew	1

it	4
was	4
obvious	1
that	4
what	3
he	4

among	2

first	3

He	4

And	3
,	5
from	4
the	6
first	3
,	5
he	4
faced	1
a	5
difficult	2
task	1
.	5

The	4
expedition	1
that	4
had	4
discovered	1
Ozagen	0
had	4
succeeded	1
in	5
correlating	0
two	3
thousand	1
Siddo	1
words	2
with	4
an	4
equal	2
number	3
of	5
American	3
words	2
.	5

The	4
description	1
of	5
the	6
Siddo	1
syntax	0
was	4
very	3
restricted	0
.	5

And	3
,	5
as	4
Hal	2
found	3
out	3
,	5
obviously	1
mistaken	1
in	5
many	3
cases	2
.	5

This	3
discovery	1
caused	2
Hal	2
anxiety	1
.	5

His	3
duty	1
was	4
to	5
write	2
a	5
school	2
text	0
and	5
to	5
teach	1
the	6
entire	2
personnel	1
of	5
the	6
Gabriel	1
how	3
to	5
speak	2
Ozagen	0
.	5

Yet	2
,	5
if	3
he	4
used	3
all	4
of	5
the	6
little	3
means	2
at	4
his	4
disposal	1
,	5
he	4
would	4
be	4
instructing	0
his	4
students	2
wrongly	0
.	5

Moreover	1
,	5
even	3
getting	2
this	4
across	2
would	4
be	4
difficult	2
.	5

For	3
one	4
thing	2
,	5
the	6
organs	1
of	5
speech	1
of	5
the	6
Ozagen	0
natives	0
differed	1
somewhat	2
from	4
Earthmen	0
's	4
;	4
the	6
sounds	1
made	3
by	4
these	3
organs	1
were	4
,	5
therefore	2
,	5
dissimilar	0
.	5

It	3
was	4
true	2
that	4
they	4
could	3
be	4
approximated	0
,	5
but	4
would	4
the	6
Ozagenians	0
understand	2
these	3
approximations	0
?	4

Another	2
obstacle	0
was	4
the	6
grammatical	0
construction	1
of	5
Siddo	1
.	5

Consider	1
the	6
tense	0
system	2
.	5

Instead	1
of	5
inflecting	0
a	5
verb	0
or	4
using	2
an	4
unattached	0
particle	1
to	5
indicate	1
the	6
past	2
or	4
future	2
,	5
Siddo	1
used	3
an	4
entirely	2
different	2
word	2
.	5

Thus	2
,	5
the	6
masculine	0
animate	0
infinitive	0
dabhumaksanigalu'ahai	0
,	5
meaning	2
to	5
live	2
,	5
was	4
,	5
in	5
the	6
perfect	1
tense	0
,	5
ksu'u'peli'afo	0
,	5
and	5
,	5
in	5
the	6
future	2
,	5
mai'teipa	0
.	5

The	4
same	3
use	3
of	5
an	4
entirely	2
different	2
word	2
applied	2
for	4
all	4
the	6
other	3
tenses	0
.	5

Plus	0
the	6
fact	2
that	4
Siddo	1
not	4
only	3
had	4
the	6
normal	2
(	3
to	5
Earthmen	0
)	3
three	3
genders	0
of	5
masculine	0
,	5
feminine	0
,	5
and	5
neuter	0
,	5
but	4
the	6
two	3
extra	1
of	5
inanimate	0
and	5
spiritual	1
.	5

Fortunately	0
,	5
gender	0
was	4
inflected	0
,	5
though	2
the	6
expression	2
of	5
it	4
would	4
be	4
difficult	2
for	4
anybody	1
not	4
born	2
in	5
Siddo	1
.	5

The	4
system	2

down	3

``	4

her	3

went	3
up	3

up	3

eyes	2

letting	1
himself	3

determined	2
not	4

They	3
lay	2

interrupt	0
it	4

at	4
any	3

He	4
had	4
a	5
feeling	2
that	4

girl	2
meant	1
trouble	2

If	3
she	3
did	3

he	4
could	3
stand	2
it	4

He	4
scrubbed	0
absent-mindedly	0
at	4

reflected	1
on	4
how	3

turned	2
out	3

That	3
afternoon	2
when	3
they	4
had	4
pulled	1
up	3

the	6
broken-down	0
ranch	0

his	4
hopes	1

been	4
high	3

Already	0
some	3

gone	2
from	4
Amelia	0

death	2

Not	2
all	4

it	4

There	3
would	4
still	3
be	4
plenty	1

moments	1

regret	0

sadness	0

guilty	1
relief	1

But	3
they	4
were	4
starting	1

everything	2

Six	1

the	6
grass	1
was	4
there	3

in	5
some	3
places	2
the	6
ground	2
was	4
too	3
steep	0
for	4

it	4

out	3

upper	2

was	4
biting	0
into	3
a	5

that	4

somewhat	2

it	4

when	3

bitten	0
off	3

she	3

``	4
One	2
has	3
always	2
been	4
tempted	0
to	5
compare	1
the	6

The	4
great	3
resemblance	0
between	3

attractions	0
and	5
repulsions	0
and	5
the	6
similarity	0
of	5
their	4
laws	1
necessarily	1
would	4
bring	2
about	3
this	4
comparison	1
.	5

It	3
is	4
true	2
,	5
that	4
nothing	2
has	3
been	4
found	3
comparable	1
with	4
electricity	1
by	4
communication	1
;	4
but	4
the	6
phenomena	1
observed	2
had	4
such	3
a	5
degree	2
of	5
analogy	1
to	5
those	3
depending	1
on	4
electrical	1
distribution	2
that	4
one	4
could	3
not	4
find	2
the	6
slightest	0
difference	2
.	5

The	4
form	2
of	5
galvanic	0
activity	2
is	4
halfway	1
between	3
the	6
magnetic	1
form	2

the	6
electrical	1
form	2

There	3
,	5
forces	2
are	4
more	3
latent	0
than	3
in	5
electricity	1
,	5
and	5
less	2
than	3
in	5
magnetism	1

But	3
in	5
such	3
an	4
important	2
question	2

we	3
would	4
be	4
satisfied	1
if	3
the	6
judgment	1

the	6
principal	1
objection	0
to	5
the	6
identity	1

only	3

not	4
a	5
thing	2

is	4
contrary	1
to	5
it	4

One	2
could	3
also	3
add	1
to	5
these	3
analogies	0
that	4
steel	1
loses	0
its	3
magnetism	1
by	4
heat	2

which	4
proves	1
that	4
steel	1
becomes	2
a	5
better	2
conductor	1
through	3
a	5
rise	2
in	5
temperature	2
,	5
just	3
as	4
electrical	1
bodies	1
do	3

It	3
is	4
also	3
found	3
that	4
magnetism	1
exists	1
in	5
all	4
bodies	1
of	5
nature	2

as	4
proven	0
by	4
Bruckmann	0

By	2

one	4

And	3
when	3

it	4

Gouldings	0

sang	1

And	3
so	3
Mel	1

got	2
the	6

He	4
set	2
out	3

One	2
of	5

Carroll	1

That	3

Captain	1

Goulding	1

the	6
absence	2
of	5

This	3
much	3
having	2
been	4
said	3

the	6
question	2
remains	2
whether	2
we	3
have	4
the	6
resources	1

have	4
to	5
do	3

defeat	1

if	3
so	3

how	3
those	3
resources	1

used	3

This	3
brings	1
us	3
squarely	0
to	5
the	6
problem	2
of	5
power	2
,	5
and	5
the	6
uses	1
a	5
nation	2
makes	2
of	5
power	2

I	4
submit	0
that	4
this	4
is	4
the	6
key	1
problem	2

that	4
it	4
always	2
has	3
been	4
,	5
that	4
it	4
always	2
will	3
be	4
.	5

And	3
I	4
suggest	1
further	2
that	4
the	6
main	2
cause	2
of	5
the	6
trouble	2
we	3
are	4
in	5
has	3
been	4
the	6
failure	1
of	5

In	3

I	4

put	2
them	3

that	4

how	3
any	3

The	4
argument	2

advanced	1
in	5
terms	2

U.	1

``	4

Prestige	0
,	5
however	2

is	4
only	3
a	5
minor	1
part	3
of	5
the	6
problem	2
;	4
and	5
even	3
then	3
,	5
it	4
is	4
a	5
concept	1
that	4
can	3
be	4
highly	2
misleading	0

Prestige	0

measure	1

how	3

contrary	1

Only	2
the	6
vain	1

incurably	0

among	2

The	4
thing	2
to	5
lose	1

over	3
is	4
what	3
people	3

concluded	1
that	4
we	3

we	3
are	4

do	3
about	3
it	4

The	4
evidence	2

This	3
ignorant	1
estimate	1

repeat	1

is	4
not	4
of	5
any	3
interest	2
in	5

it	4

what	3

the	6
extent	2

that	4

I	4

the	6
importance	2

for	4

academically	0
talented	0

highly	2

In	3
the	6
Negro	1
neighborhoods	1
and	5
also	3
to	5
some	3
extent	2
in	5
the	6
mixed	1
neighborhoods	1
the	6
problem	2
may	3
be	4
one	4
of	5
identification	1
and	5
motivation	0
.	5

High	1
motivation	0
towards	2
higher	2
education	2
must	3
start	2
early	2
enough	2
so	3
that	4
by	4
the	6
time	3
the	6
boy	2
or	4
girl	2
reaches	1
grade	1
9	1
he	4
or	4
she	3
has	3
at	4
least	2
developed	2
those	3
basic	2
skills	1
which	4
are	4
essential	1
for	4
academic	1
work	3
.	5

Undoubtedly	0
far	2
more	3
can	3
be	4
done	2
in	5
the	6
lower	2
grades	0
in	5
this	4
regard	2
in	5
the	6
Negro	1
schools	2
.	5

However	2
,	5
the	6
teacher	2
can	3
only	3
go	3
so	3
far	2
if	3
the	6
attitude	2
of	5
the	6
community	2
and	5
the	6
family	2
is	4
anti-intellectual	0
.	5

And	3
the	6
fact	2
remains	2
that	4
there	3
are	4
today	2
few	3
shining	1
examples	1
of	5
Negroes	1
in	5
positions	1
of	5
intellectual	1
leadership	1
.	5

This	3
is	4
not	4
due	2
to	5
any	3
policy	2
of	5
discrimination	1
on	4
the	6
part	3
of	5
the	6
Northern	1
universities	1

Quite	0
the	6
contrary	1

as	4
I	4
can	3
testify	0
from	4
personal	2
experience	2
as	4
a	5
former	2
university	1
president	1
.	5

Rather	1
we	3
see	3
here	3
another	3
vicious	1
circle	1

The	4
absence	2
of	5
successful	2
Negroes	1
in	5
the	6
world	3

scholarship	0
and	5
science	1
has	3
tended	1
to	5
tamp	0
down	3
enthusiasm	1
among	2
Negro	1
youth	1
for	4
academic	1
careers	0
.	5

I	4
believe	2
the	6
situation	2
is	4
improving	1
,	5
but	4
the	6
success	2
stories	1
need	2
to	5
be	4
heavily	1
publicized	1
.	5

Here	2
again	3
we	3
run	2
into	3
the	6
roadblock	0
that	4
Negroes	1
do	3
not	4
like	3
to	5
be	4
designated	0
as	4
Negroes	1
in	5
the	6
press	1
.	5

How	2
can	3
the	6
vicious	1
circle	1
be	4
broken	1
?	4

This	3
is	4
a	5
problem	2
to	5
which	4
leaders	1
of	5
opinion	1
,	5
both	3
Negro	1

white	2
,	5
should	3
devote	1
far	2
more	3
attention	2

It	3
is	4
at	4

in	5

I	4
should	3
like	3

four	2
points	2

made	3

my	3
first	3
report	2
with	4
respect	2

education	2
.	5

First	2
and	5
foremost	0

,	5
vocational	2
courses	2
should	3
be	4
provided	1
in	5

12	2
and	5
not	4
require	1
more	3
than	3
half	2

years	3
;	4
however	2

for	4
slow	1
learners	0

prospective	0

these	3

begin	2
earlier	2
.	5

Third	1

the	6
significance	1
of	5

is	4
that	4
those	3

this	4

In	3

speaking	1

the	6

In	3

in	5

grade	1
was	4
doing	2

``	4

``	4

In	3
my	3
view	2

there	3
should	3
be	4
