Just Property
a_few Property

In O
such Property

In O

The O
objectification Agentive

certainly Property

In O

There O

nothing Mental

Apart Property

no O

for O
it O

Think Mental

for_example Property

of O

Surely Property
this O

a O

we O
all O

We O

Yet O
it O
exists UnboundedEvent

an O

So Property
it O
is UnboundedEvent
too Property
with O

the O

Every O

if O

In O

us O

the O
close Property

between O

is UnboundedEvent
likely Property
to O
prove UnboundedEvent
the O
most Property
fruitful Property
. O
For O
it O
is UnboundedEvent
primarily Property
in O
community Object
that O
we O
know Mental

spirit Animate

It O
is UnboundedEvent
spirit Animate

It O

the O

Yet O
the O
spirit Animate

lives UnboundedEvent
in O
community Object
is UnboundedEvent
not Property
identical Property

the O

. O
The O
idea Mental

the O
idea Mental

are UnboundedEvent
two Property
distinct Property
and O
separable Property
ideas Mental
. O
One O
characteristic Property
of O
the O
spirit Animate
in O
community Object
is UnboundedEvent
its O

. O
The O
members Animate
of O
the O
community Object
do O
not Property
create Agentive
the O
spirit Animate
but O
rather Property
find Mental
it O

them O
. O
It O
is UnboundedEvent
for O
them O
a O

which O
they O

they O
alone Property

The O
spirit Animate
of O
the O
Marine_Corps Object
was UnboundedEvent

operative Property
before O
any O

the O

It O

they O

There O
is UnboundedEvent
an O
ancient Property

venerable Property
tradition Mental
in O
the O
church Object
( O
which O
derives UnboundedEvent
, O
however Property
, O
from O
the O
heritage Mental
of O
the O
Greeks Animate
rather Property
than O
from O
the O
Bible Mental
) O
that O
God Animate
is UnboundedEvent
completely Property
independent Property
of O
his O

and O
so O
has Mental
no O
need UnboundedEvent
of O
men Animate
for O
accomplishing Agentive
his O
work Agentive
in O
the O
world Object
. O
by O
analogy Mental
, O
the O
church Object
also Property
has O
been O
regarded_as Mental
entirely Property
independent Property
of O
the O
`` O

'' O
in O
the O
sense Mental
of O
requiring UnboundedEvent
nothing Mental
from O
it O
in_order O
to O
be UnboundedEvent
the O
church Object
. O
But O
, O
as O
Scripture Mental
everywhere Property
reminds Mental
us O
, O
God Animate
does O
have Mental
need UnboundedEvent
of O
his O
creatures Object
, O
and O
the O
church Object
, O
a_fortiori Property
, O
can O
ill Property

the O
talents Animate

which O
the O
world Object

by O
God Animate

providence Agentive
, O
presents Mental
it O
. O
And O
yet Property
this O
is UnboundedEvent
exactly Property
the O
risk UnboundedEvent
we O
run UnboundedEvent
when O
we O
assume Mental
, O
as O
we O
too Property
often Property
do O
, O
that O
we O
can O
continue Mental
to O
preach Mental
the O
gospel Mental
in O
a O
form Mental
that O
makes BoundedEvent
it O
seem Mental
incredible Property

irrelevant Property

Until O
we O
translate Mental
this O
gospel Mental
into O
a O
language Mental
that O
enlightened Property

today Property
can O
understand Mental
, O
we O
are O
depriving Mental

the O
very Property

on O
which O
the O
continued Property
success BoundedEvent
of O
our O
witness Mental
most Property
certainly Property
depends UnboundedEvent

In O
arguing Mental
in O
this O
way Property
, O
we O
are O
obviously Property
taking Mental
for O
granted Property
that O
a O
demythologized Property
restatement Mental

the O
kerygma Mental
can O
be O
achieved Agentive
; O
and O
that O
we O
firmly Property
believe Mental
this O
will O
presently Property
become BoundedEvent
evident Property
when O
we O
set_forth Mental
reasons Mental
to O
justify Mental
such Property
a O
conviction Mental
. O
But O
the O
main Property
point Mental
here Property
is UnboundedEvent
that O
even Property
if O
such Property
a O
restatement Mental
were UnboundedEvent
not Property
possible Property
, O
the O
demand Mental
to O
demythologize BoundedEvent
the O

would O
still Property
be UnboundedEvent
unavoidable Property
. O
This O
is UnboundedEvent
what O
we O
mean Mental
when O
we O
say Mental
this O
demand Mental
must O
be O
accepted Mental
without O
condition Mental
. O
If O
to O

a O
Christian Animate

to O

yes O
where O
I O
otherwise Property

no O
, O
or O
where O
I O
do O
not Property
have Mental
the O
right Property

anything O
at_all Property

then Property
my O
only Property
choice Mental
is UnboundedEvent
to O
refuse Mental
to O
be UnboundedEvent
a O
Christian Animate
. O
Expressed Mental
differently Property
: O
if O
the O
price Property
for O

a O
faithful Property
follower Animate
of O
Jesus_Christ Animate

some O
form Mental
of O
self-destruction Agentive

whether O

then Property
there O

no O

that O

This O
must O
be O
stressed Mental

it O

absolutely Property
essential Property

the O

What O
makes BoundedEvent
this O
long Property
and O
diverse Property
tradition Mental
essentially Property
one Property
is UnboundedEvent
that O
those O
who O
have O
belonged_to UnboundedEvent
it O
have O
been UnboundedEvent
profoundly Property
in_earnest Property
about O
being UnboundedEvent
modern Property
men Animate
in O
a O
distinctively Property
modern_world Mental
. O
Although O
they O
have O
also Property
been O
concerned UnboundedEvent
to O
stand Mental
squarely Property
within O
the O
tradition Mental
of O
the O
apostolic Property

, O
they O
have O
exhibited Mental
no O
willingness Property
whatever O
to O
sacrifice Mental
their O
modernity Property

They O
have O
insisted Mental
, O
rather Property
, O
on O
living UnboundedEvent
fully Property

completely Property
within O
modern Property
culture Mental
and O
, O
so Property
far Property
from O
considering Mental
this O
treason Agentive

God Animate
, O
have O
looked_upon Mental
it O
as O
the O
only Property
way Agentive
they O
could O
be UnboundedEvent
faithful Property
to O

. O
When O
we O
say Mental
, O
then Property
, O
that O
today Property
, O
in O
our O
situation UnboundedEvent
, O
the O
demand Mental
for O
demythologization Mental
must O
be O
accepted Mental
without O
condition Mental
, O
we O
are O
simply Property
saying Mental
that O
at_least Property
this O
much Mental
of O
the O
liberal Property
tradition Mental
is UnboundedEvent
an O
enduring Property
achievement Agentive
. O
However Property
much Mental
we O
may O
have O
to O
criticize Mental
liberal Property
theology Mental

constructive Property
formulations Mental
, O
the O
theology Mental
we O
ourselves O
must O
strive Agentive
to O
formulate Mental
can O
only Property
go Agentive
beyond Property
liberalism Mental
, O
not Property
behind O
it O
. O
In O
affirming Mental
this O
we O
have O
already Property
taken Agentive
the O
decisive Property
step Agentive
in O
breaking BoundedEvent
the O
deadlock UnboundedEvent
into O
which O
Bultmann Animate
's O
attempt Agentive
to O
formulate Mental
such Property
a O
theology Mental
has O
led UnboundedEvent
. O
For O
we O
have O
said Mental
, O
in_effect Property
, O
that O
of O
the O
two Property
alternatives Mental
to O
his O
position Mental
variously Property
represented Agentive
by O
the O
other Property
participants Animate
in O
the O
demythologizing BoundedEvent
discussion Mental
, O
only Property
one Mental
is UnboundedEvent
really Property
an O
alternative Mental
. O
If O
the O
demand Mental
for O
demythologization Mental
is UnboundedEvent
unavoidable Property
and O
so O
must O
be O
accepted Mental
by O
theology Mental
unconditionally Property
, O
the O
position Mental
of O
the O
`` O
right Object
'' O
is UnboundedEvent
clearly Property
untenable Property
. O
Whereas O
Bultmann Animate
's O
`` O
center Object
'' O
position Mental
is UnboundedEvent
structurally Property
inconsistent Property
and O
is UnboundedEvent
therefore Property
indefensible Property
on O
formal Property
grounds Mental
alone Property
, O
the O
general Property
position Mental
of O
the O
`` O
right Object
'' O
, O
as O
represented Agentive
, O
say O
, O
by O
Karl_Barth Animate
, O
involves UnboundedEvent
the O
rejection Agentive
or O
at_least Property
qualification Agentive
of O
the O
demand Mental
for O
demythologization Mental
and O
so O
is O
invalidated Agentive
on O
the O
material Property
grounds Mental
we O
have O
just Property
considered Mental
. O
It O
follows UnboundedEvent
, O
then Property
, O
provided O
the O
possibilities Mental
have O
been O
exhausted Agentive
, O
that O
the O
only Property
real Property
alternative Mental
is UnboundedEvent
the O
general Property
viewpoint Mental
of O
the O
`` O

'' O
, O
which O
has O
been O
represented Agentive
on O
the O
Continent Object
by O
Fritz_Buri Animate
and O
, O
to O
some Property
extent UnboundedEvent
at_least Property
, O
is O
found Mental
in O
much Mental
that O
is UnboundedEvent
significant Property
in O
American Property
and O
English Property
theology Mental
. O
In_order O
to O
make BoundedEvent
the O
implications Mental
of O
our O
position Mental
as O
clear Property
as O
possible Property
, O
we O
may O
develop Mental
this O
argument Mental
at O
greater Property
length Property
. O
We O
may O
show Mental
, O
first Property
, O
that O
there O
cannot O
possibly Property
be UnboundedEvent
an O
alternative Mental
other_than Property
the O
three Mental
typically Property
represented Agentive
by O
Bultmann Animate
, O
Barth Animate
, O
and O
Buri Animate
. O
To O
do Agentive
this O
, O
it O
is UnboundedEvent
sufficient Property
to O
point_out Mental
that O
if O
the O
principle Mental
in_terms_of Property
which O
alternatives Mental
are O
to O
be O
conceived Agentive
is UnboundedEvent
such_as O
to O
exclude Mental
more_than Property
two Mental
, O
then Property
the O
question Mental
of O
a O
`` O
third Property
'' O
possibility Mental
is UnboundedEvent
a O
meaningless Property
question Mental
. O
Thus Property
, O
if O
what O
is UnboundedEvent
at_issue Property
is UnboundedEvent
whether O
`` O
All Property
S O
is UnboundedEvent
P O
'' O
, O
it O
is UnboundedEvent
indifferent Property
whether O
`` O
Some Property
S O

not Property
P O
'' O
or O
`` O
No Property
S O

P O
'' O
, O
since O
in O
either O
case UnboundedEvent
the O
judgment Mental
in_question Property
is UnboundedEvent
false Property
. O
Hence Property
, O
if O
what O
is UnboundedEvent
in_question Property
is UnboundedEvent
whether O
in O
a O
given Property
theology Mental
myth Mental
is O
or O

completely Property

, O
it O
is UnboundedEvent
unimportant Property
whether O
only Property
a_little Property

accepted Mental
; O
for O
, O
in O
either O
event UnboundedEvent
, O
the O
first Property
possibility Mental

. O
Therefore Property
, O
the O
only Property
conceivable Property
alternatives Mental
are UnboundedEvent
those O
represented Agentive
, O
on_the_one_hand Property
, O
by O
the O
two Property
at_least Property
apparently Property
self-consistent Property
but O
mutually_exclusive Property
positions Mental
of O
Buri Animate

Barth Animate

, O
on_the_other_hand Property
, O
by O
the O
third Property
but O
really Property
pseudo Property

( O
analogous Property
to O
a O

) O
of O
Bultmann Animate

A O
second Property

requires UnboundedEvent
more Property
extended Property
comment Mental
. O
It O
will O
be O
recalled Mental
from O
the O
discussion Mental
in O
Section Mental
7 Property
that O
the O
position Mental
of O
the O
`` O

, O
as O
represented Agentive
by O
Barth Animate
, O
rests_on UnboundedEvent
the O
following Property
thesis Mental
: O
The O
only Property
tenable Property
alternative Mental
to O
Bultmann Animate
's O
position Mental
is UnboundedEvent
a O
theology Mental
that O
( O
1 O
) O
rejects Mental
or O
at_least Property
qualifies BoundedEvent
his O
unconditioned Property
demand Mental

( O

accepts Mental

a O

( O

in O

`` O

They O

in_fact Property

Irenaeus Animate
does O

therefore Property
there O

no O

The O
biblical Property
symbol Mental

expressed Mental
in O
the O
words Mental
: O
`` O
So Property

so Property
most Property

in O
the O
statement Mental
: O
`` O
If O

Thus Property

true Property

His O
interpretation Mental

That O

This O
leads Mental
Irenaeus Animate

Man Animate

life Mental

`` O
Wherefore Property

He O
[ O

him O

some O

because O

[ O

This O
idea Mental

which O
occurs UnboundedEvent
in O
both O
Tatian Animate

fits UnboundedEvent

well Property
into O
the O
scheme Mental

Irenaeus Animate
' O
theology Mental
; O
for O
it O
prepares BoundedEvent

way Object

the O
passage Agentive
from O
life UnboundedEvent
through O
death UnboundedEvent
to O
life UnboundedEvent
that O
is O
achieved Agentive
in O
Christ Animate
. O
As O
man Animate
can O
live UnboundedEvent
only Property
by O
dying BoundedEvent
, O
so Property
it O
was UnboundedEvent
only Property
by O
his O
dying BoundedEvent
that O
Christ Animate
could O
bring UnboundedEvent
many Property
to O
life UnboundedEvent
. O
It O
is UnboundedEvent
probably Property
fair Property
to O
say Mental
that O
the O
idea Mental
of O
death Physical
is UnboundedEvent
more Property
profound Property
in O
Irenaeus Animate
than O
the O
idea Mental
of O
sin Property
is UnboundedEvent
. O
This O
applies UnboundedEvent
to O
his O
picture Mental
of O
Adam Animate
. O
It O
is O
borne_out UnboundedEvent
also Property
by O
the O
absence UnboundedEvent
of O
any O
developed Property
theory Mental
about O
how O
sin Property
passes BoundedEvent
from O
one Property
generation Object

the O
next Property

It O
becomes BoundedEvent
most Property
evident Property
in O
his O
description Mental
of O
Christ Animate
as O
the O
second Property
Adam Animate
, O
who O
does O
indeed Property
come BoundedEvent
to O
destroy Agentive
sin Property
, O
but O
whose O
work Agentive
culminates BoundedEvent
in O
the O
achievement Agentive
of O
immortality Property
. O
This O
emphasis Property
upon O
death Physical
rather Property
than O
sin Property
as O
man Object
's O
fundamental Property
problem UnboundedEvent
Irenaeus Animate
shares UnboundedEvent
with O
many Property
early Property
theologians Animate
, O
especially Property
the O
Greek Mental
speaking Mental
ones O
. O
They O
speak Mental
of O
the O
work Agentive
of O
Christ Animate
as O
the O
bestowal Agentive
of O
incorruptibility Property
, O
which O
can O
mean UnboundedEvent
( O
though O
it O
does O
not Property
have O
to O
mean UnboundedEvent
) O
deliverance Agentive
from O
time Mental
and O
history Mental
. O
Death Physical
reminds Mental
man Animate
of O
his O
sin Property
, O
but O
it O
reminds Mental
him O
also Property
of O
his O
transience Property
. O
It O
represents Mental
a O
punishment Agentive
that O
he O
knows Mental
he O
deserves UnboundedEvent
, O
but O
it O
also Property
symbolizes Mental
most Property
dramatically Property
that O
he O
lives UnboundedEvent
his O
life Mental
within O
the O
process UnboundedEvent
of O
time Mental
. O
These O
two Property
aspects Property
of O
death Physical
cannot O
be O
successfully Property
separated Mental
, O
but O
they O
dare O
not Property
be O
confused Mental
or O
identified Mental
. O
The O
repeated Property
efforts Agentive
in O
Christian Property
history Mental
to O
describe Mental
death Physical
as O
altogether Property
the O
consequence Physical
of O
human Property
sin Property
show Mental
that O
these O
two Property
aspects Property

death Physical
cannot O
be O
separated Mental

Such Property
efforts Agentive
almost Property
always Property
find Mental
themselves O
compelled Property
to O
ask Mental
whether O
Adam Animate

created Agentive
capable Property
of O
growing BoundedEvent
old Property
and_then Property
older Property
and_then Property
still Property
older Property
, O
in_short Property
, O
whether O
Adam Animate

life UnboundedEvent
was O
intended Mental
to O
be UnboundedEvent
part UnboundedEvent
of O
the O
process UnboundedEvent
of O
time Mental

If O
it O
was O
, O
then Property
it O
must O
have O

God Animate

intention Mental
to O
translate UnboundedEvent
him O
at O
a O
certain Property
point Mental
from O
time Mental

eternity Mental

One Property
night Mental
, O
so Property
some Property
of O
these O
theories Mental
run UnboundedEvent
, O
Adam Animate
would O
have O
fallen_asleep BoundedEvent
, O
much_as Property
he O
fell_asleep BoundedEvent
for O
the O
creation BoundedEvent
of O
Eve Animate
; O
and O
thus Property
he O
would O
have O
been O
carried_over BoundedEvent
into O
the O
life_eternal UnboundedEvent
. O
The O
embarrassment BoundedEvent
of O
these O
theories Mental
over O
the O
naturalness Property
of O
death Physical
is UnboundedEvent
an O
illustration Mental
of O
the O
thesis Mental
that O
death Physical
cannot O
be UnboundedEvent
only Property
a O
punishment Agentive

for O
some O
termination Mental
seems Mental
necessary Property
in O
a O
life UnboundedEvent
that O
is O
lived UnboundedEvent
within O
the O
natural_order Object
of O
time Mental
and O
change BoundedEvent

On_the_other_hand Property
, O
Christian Property
faith Object
knows Mental
that O
death Physical

more Mental
than O
the O
natural Property
termination Mental

It O
is UnboundedEvent
the O
wages BoundedEvent
of O
sin Property
, O
and O
its O
sting UnboundedEvent
is UnboundedEvent
the O
law Mental
. O
If O
this O
aspect Property
of O
death Physical
as O
punishment Agentive
is O
not Property
distinguished Mental
from O
the O
idea Mental
of O
death Physical
as O
natural Property
termination Mental
, O
the O
conclusion Mental
seems Mental
inevitable Property
that O
temporal Property
existence UnboundedEvent
itself O
is UnboundedEvent
a O
form Mental
of O
punishment Agentive
rather Property
than O
the O
state UnboundedEvent
into O
which O
man Object

put UnboundedEvent
by O
the O
will Mental
of O
the O
Creator Animate

This O
seems Mental
to O
have O
been UnboundedEvent
the O
conclusion Mental
to O
which O
Origen Animate
was O
forced Agentive
. O
If O
death Physical
receives BoundedEvent
more_than Property
its O
share Agentive
of O
attention Agentive
from O
the O
theologian Animate

if O
sin Property
receives BoundedEvent
less_than Property
its O
share Agentive

the O

Such Property
an O
interpretation Mental

Christian Property

it O

About O

Henri Animate

Of_course Property
he O

he O

crazy Property

really Property

But O
he O
was UnboundedEvent
totally Property

It O

`` O

That O

when O

went_to Mental
Professor_Claude Animate

at_once Property
Claude Animate

what O
the O

he O

In O

The O
basic Property

In O

Immediately Property

the O

improved BoundedEvent

it O
improved BoundedEvent

Physically Property

This O

an O

because O
it O

When O
I O

they O

I O
find Mental
that O
they O
fall_into UnboundedEvent
two Property

the O
simpler Property
ones O
who O
have O
simply Property
accepted Mental
the O
shibboleths Mental

the O
intelligent Property

cynical Property

these O

count UnboundedEvent
any_more Property

I O
am UnboundedEvent
naive Property
, O
they O
say Mental

such Property
words Mental
. O
I O
take Mental
this O
to O
mean UnboundedEvent
that O
the O
intelligent Property
- O
and O
therefore Property
necessarily Property
cynical Property
? O
- O
liberal Animate
considers Mental
that O

essential Property

because O

To O

such Property

reiterates Mental
the O

But O
a O
somewhat Property

The O

apparently Property
gave_rise Agentive

which O
we O
still Property
recognize Mental
. O
It O
is UnboundedEvent
curious Property
that O
even Property
centuries Mental

This O
and O
other Property

of O

disappeared BoundedEvent
gradually Property

with O
the O
Ptolemaic_system Mental

more Property

of O
an O
universal Property
force Physical
that O

account UnboundedEvent
quantitatively Property
for O
both O
terrestrial Property

This O
understanding Mental
provides Mental
a O
very Property
simple Property
example Mental
of O
the O
fact Mental
that O
one O
can O
eliminate BoundedEvent
fear Mental
without O
instituting Agentive
any O

In_fact Property
, O
although O
we O
have O
dispelled BoundedEvent
the O

we O
have O
not Property
necessarily Property

ourselves O
that O

There O

A O

Our O

taught Mental
us O
to O
replace BoundedEvent
our O
former Property
elaborate Property

with O
the O
appropriate Property
action Agentive
which O
, O
in O
this O

amounts UnboundedEvent

doing Agentive
nothing Mental

Yet O
we O
no_longer Property
feel Mental
uneasy Property
. O
This O
almost Property
trivial Property
example Mental
is UnboundedEvent
nevertheless Property
suggestive Property
, O
for O
there O
are UnboundedEvent
some O
elements Mental
in_common Property
between O
the O
antique Property

that O
the O

get BoundedEvent

We O

in O

, O
if O

will O
not Property

primarily Property
of O
our O

And O
yet Property
we O
obviously Property

believe Mental
that O
the O

We O
have O
staved_off Agentive
a O
war UnboundedEvent
and O
, O
since O
our O
behavior Agentive
has O
involved UnboundedEvent
all O
these O
elements Mental
, O
we O
can O
only Property
keep UnboundedEvent
adding BoundedEvent
to O
our O
ritual Agentive
without O
daring Agentive

abandon Mental
any O

, O
since O
we O
have Mental

the O

I O
think Mental
that O
we O
are O
here Property
also Property
talking_of Mental
the O
kind Mental
of O

a O

If O

even_though O

not Property

With O
the O
group Object

it O
is UnboundedEvent

He O
does O
not Property

whether O

When O

I O

no O

I O

I O

in_a_way Property

but O
certainly Property
my O

the O

I O

filled BoundedEvent
with O
an O
uneasiness Mental
that O
through O

Our O
inability Mental
to O
explain Mental
why O
certain Property

fond Property
of O

frequently Property
induces Agentive
the O

We O
are O
forced Agentive
, O
in O
our O
behavior Property
towards O

, O
to O
adopt Mental
empirically Property
successful Property
patterns Agentive
in_toto Property
because O
we O

such Property

Our O
collective Property

we O

The O
achievements Agentive

three Property

What O
additional Property
roles Agentive

the O
scientific Property

19th Property

? O
In O
the O
physical_sciences Mental

these O

electricity Physical

In O

there O

in O

bio Property

The O
major Property

these O

to O
lie_in UnboundedEvent
the O
part Mental
they O
have O
played Agentive
in O
the O
industrial_revolution Mental

in O
the O

which O
scientific Property

given Mental
us O
to O

a O
more Property
protective Property

In_addition Property
, O
our O
way Agentive
of O
dealing Mental
directly Property
with O
natural_phenomena Physical
has O
also Property
changed BoundedEvent
. O
Even Property
in O
domains UnboundedEvent
where O
detailed Property

still Property
lacking UnboundedEvent

where O
some O

the O

Apparently Property
the O

enough Property
confidence Mental

the O

How O

why O
this O

would O
provide Mental
an O
interesting Property

In O
some O
areas Mental
, O
the O

slower Property

. O
In O
agriculture Agentive
, O
for_example Property
, O
despite O
the O

in O
biology Mental

elaborate Property

tend UnboundedEvent

persist BoundedEvent
along O

a O

sense Mental
of O
the O
imminence UnboundedEvent

In O

the O
opposite Property

rapidly Property

parental Property

probably Property
exceeds UnboundedEvent
anything O
warranted Mental
by O

psychological Property

There O
are UnboundedEvent
many Property
domains UnboundedEvent
in O
which O

brought_about UnboundedEvent
widespread Property

quite Property
appropriate Property
reduction Agentive
in O

Much Property
of O
the O
former Property
extreme Object

associated Mental
with O

with O

has O
disappeared BoundedEvent

The O
persistent Property
horror Mental
of O
having BoundedEvent
a O
malformed Property
child Animate
has O
, O
I O
believe Mental
, O
been O
reduced BoundedEvent
, O
not Property
because O
we O
have O
gained Mental
any O
control UnboundedEvent
over O
this O
misfortune BoundedEvent

but O
precisely Property
because O
we O
have O
learned Mental
that O
we O
have Mental
so Property
little Property
control UnboundedEvent
over O
it O
. O
In_fact Property
, O
the O
recent Property
warnings Mental
about O
the O
use Agentive
of O
X-rays Physical
have O
introduced BoundedEvent
fears Mental

ambiguities Property

which O
now Property
require UnboundedEvent
more Property

and O
thus Property
in_this Property
instance BoundedEvent
, O
science Mental
has O
momentarily Property
aggravated BoundedEvent
our O

. O
In_fact Property
, O
insofar Property
as O
science Mental
generates BoundedEvent
any O

, O
it O
stems UnboundedEvent
not Property
so Property
much Property
from O
scientific Property

from O
the O
fact Mental
that O
new Property
unanswered Property

arise UnboundedEvent

which O
, O
until O

create Agentive

Perhaps Property
the O
most Property
illuminating Property
example Mental
of O
the O
reduction Agentive

through O

derived BoundedEvent

our O

The O
third Property

The O
argument Mental

What O

To O

yet O
that O

what O

It O

If O
it O

then Property
these O

the O

the O

Now Property
I O
do O
not Property

But O
before O

it O
, O
I O
should_like O

record Mental

of O
thanks Mental
to O
them O
for O
the O
clarity Property
with O
which O
they O

It O
has O

that O
he O
could O
be O
found_out Mental

This O
theory Mental
has O
been O
put Mental
so Property
clearly Property
and O
precisely Property
that O
it O
deserves UnboundedEvent
criticism Mental
of O
the O
same Property
kind Mental
, O
and O
this O
I O
will O
do Agentive
my O
best Property
to O
supply Mental
. O
The O
theory Mental
claims Mental
to O
show Mental
by O
analysis Mental
that O
when O
we O
say Mental
, O
`` O
That O
is UnboundedEvent
good Property
'' O
, O
we O
do O
not Property
mean Mental
to O
assert Mental
a O
character Mental
of O
the O
subject Mental
of O
which O
we O
are O
thinking Mental
. O
I O
shall O
argue Mental
that O
we O
do O
mean Mental
to O
do Agentive
just Property
that O
. O
Let Agentive
us O
work_through Agentive
an O
example Mental
, O
and O
the O
simpler Property
and O
commoner Property
the O
better Property
. O
There O
is O
perhaps Property
no O
value_statement Mental
on O
which O
people Object
would O
more Property
universally Property
agree Mental
than O
the O
statement Mental
that O
intense Property
pain UnboundedEvent
is UnboundedEvent
bad Property
. O
Let O
us O
take Mental
a O
set Object
of O
circumstances UnboundedEvent
in O
which O
I O
happen O
to O
be O
interested Property
on O
the O
legislative Property
side Object
and O
in O
which O
I O
think Mental
every O
one O
of O
us O
might O
naturally Property
make Agentive
such Property
a O
statement Mental
. O
We O
come_upon Mental
a O
rabbit Animate
that O
has O
been O
caught UnboundedEvent
in O
one O
of O
the O
brutal Property
traps Object
in O
common Property
use Agentive
. O
There O
are UnboundedEvent
signs Mental
that O
it O
has O
struggled UnboundedEvent
for O
days Mental
to O
escape BoundedEvent
and O
that O
in O
a O
frenzy UnboundedEvent
of O
hunger UnboundedEvent
, O
pain UnboundedEvent
, O
and O
fear Mental
, O
it O
has O
all_but Property
eaten Agentive
off O
its O
own Property
leg Object
. O
The O
attempt Agentive
failed Agentive
: O
the O
animal Animate
is UnboundedEvent
now Property
dead Property
. O
As O
we O
think_of Mental
the O
long Property
and O
excruciating Property
pain UnboundedEvent
it O
must O
have O
suffered Mental
, O
we O
are UnboundedEvent
very Property
likely Property
to O
say Mental
: O
`` O
It O
was UnboundedEvent
a O
bad Property
thing UnboundedEvent
that O
the O
little Property
animal Animate
should O
suffer BoundedEvent
so Property
'' O
. O
The O
positivist Animate
tells Mental
us O
that O
when O
we O
say Mental
this O
we O
are O
only Property
expressing Mental
our O
present Property
emotion Mental
. O
I O
hold Mental
, O
on_the_contrary Property
, O
that O
we O
mean Mental
to O
assert Mental
something O
of O
the O
pain UnboundedEvent
itself O
, O
namely Property
, O
that O
it O
was UnboundedEvent
bad Property
- O
bad Property
when O
and O
as O
it O
occurred BoundedEvent
. O
Consider Mental
what O
follows UnboundedEvent
from O
the O
positivist Animate
view Mental
. O
On O
that O
view Mental
, O
nothing Mental
good Property
or O
bad Property
happened BoundedEvent
in O
the O
case BoundedEvent
until O
I O
came_on BoundedEvent
the O
scene Object
and O
made Agentive
my O
remark Mental
. O
For O
what O
I O
express Mental
in O
my O
remark Mental
is UnboundedEvent
something O
going_on UnboundedEvent
in O
me O
at O
the O
time Mental
, O
and O
that O
of_course Property
did O
not Property
exist UnboundedEvent
until O
I O
did O
come_on BoundedEvent
the O
scene Object
. O
The O
pain UnboundedEvent
of O
the O
rabbit Animate
was UnboundedEvent
not Property
itself O
bad Property
; O
nothing Mental
evil Property
was O
happening BoundedEvent
when O
that O
pain UnboundedEvent
was O
being O
endured Mental
; O
badness Property
, O
in O
the O
only Property
sense Mental
in O
which O
it O
is O
involved UnboundedEvent
at_all Property
, O
waited UnboundedEvent
for O
its O
appearance BoundedEvent
till O
I O
came BoundedEvent
and O
looked Mental
and O
felt Mental
. O
Now Property
that O
this O
is UnboundedEvent
at_odds Property
with O
our O
meaning Mental
may O
be O
shown Mental
as_follows Property
. O
Let Agentive
us O
put UnboundedEvent
to O
ourselves O
the O
hypothesis Mental
that O
we O
had O
not Property
come_on BoundedEvent
the O
scene Object
and O
that O
the O
rabbit Animate
never Property
was O
discovered Mental
. O
Are UnboundedEvent
we O
prepared Property
to O
say Mental
that O
in O
that O
case UnboundedEvent
nothing Mental
bad Property
occurred BoundedEvent
in O
the O
sense Mental
in O
which O
we O
said Mental
it O
did O
? O
Clearly Property
not Property
. O
Indeed Property
we O
should O
say Mental
, O
on_the_contrary Property
, O
that O
the O
accident BoundedEvent
of O
our O
later Property
discovery Agentive
made Agentive
no O
difference Property
whatever O
to O
the O
badness Property
of O
the O
animal Animate
's O
pain UnboundedEvent
, O
that O
it O
would O
have O
been UnboundedEvent
every Property
whit Mental
as O
bad Property
whether O
a O
chance Property
passer-by Animate
happened BoundedEvent
later Property
to O
discover Mental
the O
body Object
and O
feel Mental
repugnance Mental
or O
not Property
. O
If O
so Property
, O
then Property
it O
is UnboundedEvent
clear Property
that O
in O
saying Mental
the O
suffering UnboundedEvent
was UnboundedEvent
bad Property
we O
are O
not Property
expressing Mental
our O
feelings Mental
only Property
. O
We O
are O
saying Mental
that O
the O
pain UnboundedEvent
was UnboundedEvent
bad Property
when O
and O
as O
it O
occurred BoundedEvent
and O
before O
anyone O
took BoundedEvent
an O
attitude Mental
toward O
it O
. O
The O
first Property
argument Mental
is UnboundedEvent
thus Property
an O
ideal Property
experiment Agentive
in O
which O
we O
use Agentive
the O
method Mental
of O
difference Property
. O
It O
removes BoundedEvent
our O
present Property
expression Mental
and O
shows Mental
that O
the O
badness Property
we O
meant Mental
would O
not Property
be O
affected BoundedEvent
by O
this O
, O
whereas O
on O
positivist Property
grounds Mental
it O
should O
be O
. O
The O
second Property
argument Mental
applies Agentive
the O
method Mental
in O
the O
reverse Property
way Property
. O
It O
ideally Property
removes BoundedEvent
the O
past Property
event BoundedEvent
, O
and O
shows Mental
that O
this O
would O
render BoundedEvent
false Property
what O
we O
mean Mental
to O
say Mental
, O
whereas O
on O
positivist Property
grounds Mental
it O
should O
not Property
. O
Let Agentive
us O
suppose Mental
that O
the O
animal Animate
did O
not Property
in_fact Property
fall BoundedEvent
into O
the O
trap Object
and O
did O
not Property
suffer BoundedEvent
at_all Property
, O
but O
that O
we O
mistakenly Property
believe Mental
it O
did O
, O
and O
say Mental
as O
before O
that O
its O
suffering UnboundedEvent
was UnboundedEvent
an O
evil Property
thing UnboundedEvent
. O
On O
the O
positivist Property
theory Mental
, O
everything O
I O
sought Agentive
to O
express Mental
by O
calling Mental
it O
evil Property
in O
the O
first Property
case BoundedEvent
is UnboundedEvent
still Property
present Property
in O
the O
second Property
. O
In O
the O
only Property

in O
which O
badness Property
is O
involved UnboundedEvent
at_all Property
, O
whatever O
was UnboundedEvent
bad Property
in O
the O
first Property
case BoundedEvent
is UnboundedEvent
still Property
present Property
in O
its O
entirety UnboundedEvent
, O
since O
all O
that O
is O
expressed Mental
in O
either O
case BoundedEvent
is UnboundedEvent
a O
state UnboundedEvent
of O
feeling Mental
, O
and O
that O
feeling Mental
is UnboundedEvent
still Property
there O
. O
And O
our O
question Mental
is UnboundedEvent
, O
is UnboundedEvent
such Property
an O
implication Mental
consistent Property
with O
what O
we O
meant Mental
? O
Clearly Property
it O
is UnboundedEvent
not Property
. O
If O
anyone O
asked Mental
us O
, O
after O
we O
made Agentive
the O
remark Mental
that O
the O
suffering UnboundedEvent
was UnboundedEvent
a O
bad Property
thing UnboundedEvent
, O
whether O
we O
should O
think Mental
it O
relevant Property
to O
what O
we O
said Mental
to O
learn Mental
that O
the O
incident BoundedEvent
had O
never Property
occurred BoundedEvent
and O
no Property
pain UnboundedEvent
had O
been O
suffered Mental
at_all Property
, O
we O
should O
say Mental
that O
it O
made Agentive
all Property
the O
difference BoundedEvent
in_the_world O
, O
that O
what O
we O
were O
asserting Mental
to O
be UnboundedEvent
bad Property
was UnboundedEvent
precisely Property
the O
suffering UnboundedEvent
we O
thought Mental
had O
occurred BoundedEvent
back Property
there Property
, O
that O
if O
this O
had O
not Property
occurred BoundedEvent
, O
there O
was UnboundedEvent
nothing Mental
left BoundedEvent
to O
be UnboundedEvent
bad Property
, O
and O
that O
our O
assertion Mental
was UnboundedEvent
in O
that O
case BoundedEvent
mistaken Property
. O
The O
suggestion Mental
that O
in O
saying Mental
something O
evil Property
had O
occurred BoundedEvent
we O
were O
after_all Property
making Agentive
no O
mistake Mental
, O
because O
we O
had O
never Property
meant Mental
anyhow Property
to O
say Mental
anything O
about O
the O
past Property
suffering UnboundedEvent
, O
seems Mental
to O
me O
merely Property
frivolous Property
. O
If O
we O
did O
not Property
mean Mental
to O
say Mental
this O
, O
why O
should O
we O
be O
so Property
relieved BoundedEvent
on O
finding Mental
that O
the O
suffering UnboundedEvent
had O
not Property
occurred BoundedEvent
? O
On O
the O
theory Mental
before O
us O
, O
such Property
relief Mental
would O
be UnboundedEvent
groundless Property
, O
for O
in O
that O
suffering UnboundedEvent
itself O
there O
was UnboundedEvent
nothing Mental
bad Property
at_all Property
, O
and O
hence Property
in O
its O
nonoccurrence UnboundedEvent
there O
would O
be UnboundedEvent
nothing Mental
to O
be O
relieved BoundedEvent
about O
. O
The O
positivist Property
theory Mental
would O
here Property
distort Mental
our O
meaning Mental
beyond O
recognition Mental
. O
So_far_as O
I O
can O
see Agentive
, O
there O
is O
only Property
one Property
way_out Object
for O
the O
positivist Animate
. O
He O
holds Mental
that O
goodness Property
and O
badness Property
lie_in UnboundedEvent
feelings Mental
of O
approval Mental
or O
disapproval Mental
. O
And O
there O
is O
a O
way Agentive
in O
which O
he O
might O
hold Mental
that O
badness Property
did O
in O
this O
case UnboundedEvent
precede UnboundedEvent
our O
own Property
feeling Mental
of O
disapproval Mental
without O
belonging_to UnboundedEvent
the O
pain UnboundedEvent
itself O
. O
The O
pain UnboundedEvent
in O
itself O
was UnboundedEvent
neutral Property
; O
but O
unfortunately Property
the O
rabbit Animate
, O
on O
no Property
grounds Mental
at_all Property
, O
took_up Mental
toward O
this O
neutral Property
object Mental
an O
attitude Mental
of O
disapproval Mental
and O
that O
made BoundedEvent
it O
for_the_first_time Property
, O
and O
in O
the O
only Property
intelligible Property
sense Mental
, O
bad Property
. O
This O
way Agentive
of O
escape Agentive
is UnboundedEvent
theoretically Property
possible Property
, O
but O
since O
it O
has Mental
grave Property
difficulties Property
of O
its O
own Property
and O
has O
not Property
, O
so_far_as O
I O
know Mental
, O
been UnboundedEvent
urged Mental
by O
positivists Animate
, O
it O
is UnboundedEvent
perhaps Property
best Property
not Property
to O
spend Mental
time Mental
over O
it O
. O
I O
come BoundedEvent
now Property
to O
a O
third Property
argument Mental
, O
which O
again Property
is UnboundedEvent
very Property
simple Property
. O
When O
we O
come_upon Mental
the O
rabbit Animate
and O
make Agentive
our O
remark Mental
about O
its O
suffering UnboundedEvent
being UnboundedEvent
a O
bad Property
thing UnboundedEvent
, O
we O
presumably Property
make Agentive
it O
with O
some O
feeling Mental
; O
the O
positivists Animate
are UnboundedEvent
plainly Property
right Property
in O
saying Mental
that O
such Property
remarks Mental
do Agentive
usually Property
express Mental
feeling Mental
. O
But O
suppose Mental
that O
a O
week Mental
later Property
we O
revert BoundedEvent
to O
the O
incident BoundedEvent
in O
thought Mental
and O
make Agentive
our O
statement Mental
again Property
. O
And O
suppose Mental
that O
the O
circumstances UnboundedEvent
have O
now Property
so Property
changed BoundedEvent
that O
the O
feeling Mental
with O
which O
we O
made Agentive
the O
remark Mental
in_the_first_place Property
has O
faded BoundedEvent
. O
The O
pathetic Property
evidence Mental
is UnboundedEvent
no_longer Property
before O
us O
; O
and O
we O
are UnboundedEvent
now Property
so Property
fatigued Property
in O
body Object
and O
mind Mental
that O
feeling Mental
is UnboundedEvent
, O
as_we_say Property
, O
quite Property
dead Property
. O
In O
these O
circumstances UnboundedEvent
, O
since O
what O
was O
expressed Mental
by O
the O
remark Mental
when O
first Property
made Agentive
is UnboundedEvent
, O
on O
the O
theory Mental
before O
us O
, O
simply Property
absent Property
, O
the O
remark Mental
now Property
expresses Mental
nothing Mental
. O
It O
is UnboundedEvent
as O
empty Property
as O
the O
word Mental
`` O
Hurrah O
'' O
would O
be UnboundedEvent
when O
there O
was UnboundedEvent
no O
enthusiasm Mental
behind O
it O
. O
And O
this O
seems Mental
to O
me O
untrue Property
. O
When O
we O
repeat Mental
the O
remark Mental
that O
such Property
suffering UnboundedEvent
was UnboundedEvent
a O
bad Property
thing UnboundedEvent
, O
the O
feeling Mental
with O
which O
we O
made Agentive
it O
last Property
week Mental
may O
be UnboundedEvent
at O
or O
near O
the O
vanishing_point Object
, O
but O
if O
we O
were O
asked Mental
whether O
we O
meant Mental
to O
say Mental
what O
we O
did O
before Property
, O
we O
should O
certainly Property
answer Mental
Yes O
. O
We O
should O
say Mental
that O
we O
made Agentive
our O
point Mental
with O
feeling Mental
the O
first Property
time BoundedEvent
and O
little Property
or O
no Property
feeling Mental
the O
second Property
time BoundedEvent
, O
but O
that O
it O
was UnboundedEvent
the O
same Property
point Mental
we O
were O
making Agentive
. O
And O
if O
we O
can O
see Mental
that O
what O
we O
meant Mental
to O
say Mental
remains BoundedEvent
the O
same Property
, O
while O
the O
feeling Mental
varies BoundedEvent
from O
intensity Property
to O
near O
zero Property
, O
it O
is UnboundedEvent
not Property
the O
feeling Mental
that O
we O
primarily Property
meant Mental
to O
express Mental
. O
I O
come BoundedEvent
now Property
to O
a O
fourth Property
consideration Mental
. O
We O
all Property
believe Mental
that O
toward O
acts Agentive
or O
effects Physical
of O
a O
certain Property
kind Mental
one Property
attitude Mental
is UnboundedEvent
fitting Property
and O
another O
not Property
; O
but O
on O
the O
theory Mental
before O
us O
such Property
a O
belief Mental
would O
not Property
make_sense UnboundedEvent
. O
Broad Animate
and O
Ross Animate
have O
lately Property
contended Mental
that O
this O
fitness Property
is UnboundedEvent
one O
of O
the O
main Property
facts Mental
of O
ethics Mental
, O
and O
I O
suspect Mental
they O
are UnboundedEvent
right Property
. O
But O
that O
is UnboundedEvent
not Property
exactly Property
my O
point Mental
. O
My O
point Mental
is UnboundedEvent
this O
: O
whether O
there O
is O
such Property
fitness Property
or O
not Property
, O
we O
all Property
assume Mental
that O
there O
is O
, O
and O
if O
we O
do O
, O
we O
express Mental
in O
moral Property
judgments Mental
more Mental
than O
the O
subjectivists Animate
say Mental
we O
do O
. O
Let Agentive
me O
illustrate Mental
. O
In O
his O
novel Mental
The_House_of_the_Dead O
, O
Dostoevsky Animate
tells Mental
of O
his O
experiences Mental
in O
a O
Siberian Object
prison_camp Object
. O
Whatever O
the O
unhappy Property
inmates Animate
of O
such Property
camps Object
are UnboundedEvent
like O
today Mental
, O
Dostoevsky Animate
's O
companions Animate
were UnboundedEvent
about Property
as O
grim Property
a O
lot Object
as O
can O
be O
imagined Agentive
. O
`` O
I O
have O
heard Mental
stories Mental
'' O
, O
he O
writes Mental
, O
`` O
of O
the O
most Property
terrible Property
, O
the O
most Property
unnatural Property
actions Agentive
, O
of O
the O
most Property
monstrous Property
murders Agentive
, O
told Mental
with O
the O
most Property
spontaneous Property
, O
childishly Property
merry Property
laughter Mental
'' O
. O
Most Property
of O
us O
would O
say Mental
that O
in O
this O
delight Mental
at O
the O
killing BoundedEvent
of O
others O
or O
the O
causing Mental
of O
suffering UnboundedEvent
there O
is O
something O
very Property
unfitting Property
. O
If O
we O
were O
asked Mental
why O
we O
thought Mental
so Property
, O
we O
should O
say Mental
that O
these O
things Agentive
involve UnboundedEvent
great Property
evil Agentive
and O
are UnboundedEvent
wrong Property
, O
and O
that O
to O
take Mental
delight Mental
in O
what O
is UnboundedEvent
evil Agentive
or O
wrong Property
is UnboundedEvent
plainly Property
unfitting Property
. O
Now Mental
on O
the O
subjectivist Animate
view Mental
, O
this O
answer Mental
is O
ruled_out UnboundedEvent
. O
For O
before O
someone Animate
takes_up Mental
an O
attitude Mental
toward O
death Mental
, O
suffering UnboundedEvent
, O
or O
their O
infliction Agentive
, O
they O
have UnboundedEvent
no O
moral Property
quality Property
at_all Property
. O
There O
is O
therefore Property
nothing Mental
about O
them O
to O
which O
an O
attitude Mental
of O
approval Mental
or O
condemnation Agentive
could O
be UnboundedEvent
fitting Property
. O
They O
are UnboundedEvent
in O
themselves O
neutral Property
, O
and O
, O
so_far_as O
they O
get Mental
a O
moral Property
quality Property
, O
they O
get Mental
it O
only Property
through O
being O
invested Agentive
with O
it O
by O
the O
attitude Mental
of O
the O
onlooker Animate
. O
But O
if O
that O
is O
true Property
, O
why O
is UnboundedEvent
any O
attitude Mental
more Property
fitting Property
than O
any O
other Property
? O
Would O
applause Mental
, O
for_example Property
, O
be O
fitting Property
if O
, O
apart Property
from O
the O
applause Mental
, O
there O
were UnboundedEvent
nothing Mental
good Property
to O
applaud Mental
? O
Would O
condemnation Agentive
be O
fitting Property
if O
, O
independently Property
of O
the O
condemnation Agentive
, O
there O
were UnboundedEvent
nothing Mental
bad Property
to O
condemn Mental
? O
In O
such Property
a O
case UnboundedEvent
, O
any O
attitude Mental
would O
be UnboundedEvent
as O
fitting Property
or O
unfitting Property
as O
any O
other Property
, O
which O
means UnboundedEvent
that O
the O
notion Mental
of O
fitness Property
has O
lost Mental
all O
point Mental
. O
Indeed Property
we O
are O
forced Agentive
to O
go Agentive
much Property
farther Property
. O
If O
goodness Property
and O
badness Property
lie_in UnboundedEvent
attitudes Mental
only Property
and O
hence Property
are O
brought UnboundedEvent
into O
being UnboundedEvent
by O
them O
, O
those O
men Animate
who O
greeted Mental
death Mental
and O
misery UnboundedEvent
with O
childishly Property
merry Property
laughter Mental
are O
taking Mental
the O
only Property
sensible Property
line Mental
. O
If O
there O
is O
nothing Mental
evil Property
in O
these O
things Agentive
, O
if O
they O
get Mental
their O
moral Property
complexion Property
only Property
from O
our O
feeling Mental
about O
them O
, O
why O
should O
n't Property
they O
be O
greeted Mental
with O
a O
cheer Mental
? O
To O
greet Mental
them O
with O
repulsion Mental
would O
turn UnboundedEvent
what O
before Property
was UnboundedEvent
neutral Property
into O
something O
bad Property
; O
it O
would O
needlessly Property
bring BoundedEvent
badness Property
into O
the O

; O
and O
even Property
on O
subjectivist Animate
assumptions Mental
that O
does O
not Property
seem Mental
very Property
bright Property
. O
On_the_other_hand Property
, O
to O
greet Mental
them O
with O
delight Mental
would O
convert BoundedEvent
what O
before Property

something O
good Property
; O
it O
would O
bring BoundedEvent

into O

According_to O

This O

The O

After O

In_short Property
, O
both O
his O

his O
figural_blindness UnboundedEvent

when O
he O
looked Mental

seem Mental

present Mental
undeniable Property

that O
he O
had Mental
simply Property
no O

He O
was UnboundedEvent
oblivious Property

he O

Therefore Property

his O

this O
he O
could O
do Agentive

going_over Mental

Then Property

This O

that O

that O

First Property

it O

That O

it O

When O

At O

when O
the O

silent Property

breathless Property
, O
a O
collection Mental
was O
taken Mental
and O
then Property
slowly Property
everyone O
filed_out BoundedEvent

The O
audience Object
did O
not Property

what O
the O

the O

he O
did O
not Property

at O

During O
the O
next Property
weeks Mental
he O
looked Mental
over O
the O
situation UnboundedEvent
. O
First_of_all Property
there O
was UnboundedEvent
the O
parsonage Object

an O
utterly Property
impossible Property

originally Property

, O
with O
no O

with O
rat-holes Object
and O
rot UnboundedEvent
. O
It O
was O
arranged Mental
that O
he O
would O
board UnboundedEvent
in O
the O
home Object
of O
one O
of O
the O
old Property
members Animate
of O
the O
church Object
, O
a O
woman Animate
named Mental
Catt Animate
who O
, O
as O
Wilson Animate
afterward Property
found Mental
, O
was O
briefly Property
referred Mental
to O
as O
The_Cat Animate
because O
of O
her O
sharp_tongue O
and O
fierce Property
initiative Property
. O
Ann_Catt Animate
was UnboundedEvent
a O
lonely Property

devoted Property
soul Mental
, O
never Property
married Agentive
, O
conducting Agentive
a O
spotless Property
home Object
and O
devoted Property
to O
her O
church Object
, O
but O
a O
perpetual Property
dissenter Animate
and O
born Property
critic Animate
. O
She O
soared BoundedEvent
over O
the O
new Property
pastor Animate
like O
an O
avenging Property
angel Animate
lest Property
he O
stray BoundedEvent
from O

not Property

all Property
the O
truth Mental
and O

of O
which O
she O
was UnboundedEvent
chief Property
repository Animate
. O
Then Property
Wilson Animate
looked Mental
over O
the O
church Object
and O
studied Mental
its O
condition UnboundedEvent
. O
The O
salary Dynamic+Possession
of O
the O
pastor Animate
had O
for O
years Mental
been UnboundedEvent
$ O
500 Property
annually Property
and O
even Property
this O
was UnboundedEvent
in_arrears Property
. O
Wilson Animate
made_up_his_mind Mental
that O
he O
must O
receive Mental
at_least Property
$ O
2500 O
, O
but O
when O
he O
mentioned Mental
this O
to O
the O
Deacons Animate
they O
said Mental
nothing Mental
. O
The O
church Object
itself O
must O
be O
repaired BoundedEvent
. O
It O
was UnboundedEvent
dirty Property
and O
neglected Property
. O
It O
really Property
ought O
to O
be O
rebuilt Property
, O
and O
he O
determined Mental
to O
go_up BoundedEvent
and O
talk Mental
to O
the O
city Object
banks Object
about O
this O
. O
Meanwhile Property
, O
the O
city Object
itself O
should O
be O
talked Mental
to O
. O
The O
streets Object
in O
the O
colored Property
section Object
were UnboundedEvent
dirty Property
. O
There O
was UnboundedEvent
typhoid UnboundedEvent
and O
malaria UnboundedEvent
. O
The O
children Animate
had Mental
nowhere Property
to O
go BoundedEvent
and O
no O
place Object
to O
play Agentive
, O
not Property
even Property
sidewalks Object
. O
The O
school Object
was UnboundedEvent
small Property
, O
dark Property
and O
ill-equipped Property
. O
The O
teacher Animate
was UnboundedEvent
a O
pliant Property
fool Animate
. O
There O
were UnboundedEvent
two Property
liquor Object
saloons Object
not Property
very Property
far Property
from O
the O

, O
one Mental
white Animate

that_is Property
conducted Agentive

white Property
people Object
with O
a O
side_entrance Object
for O
Negroes Animate
; O
the O
other Property
exclusively Property
Negro Animate

Undoubtedly Property
, O
there O
was UnboundedEvent
a O
good_deal Mental
of O

in O
both O
. O
On O
the O
other Property
side Object
of O
the O
church Object
was UnboundedEvent
a O
quiet Property
, O
well-kept Property
house Object
with O

and O
recently Property
painted UnboundedEvent
. O
Wilson Animate
inquired Mental
about O
it O
. O
It O
was UnboundedEvent
called Property
Kent_House Object
. O
The O
deacon Animate
of O
the O
church Object
, O
Carlson Animate
, O
was Agentive
its O
janitor Animate
. O
One O
of O
the O
leading Property
members Animate
of O
the O
Amen_corner Object
was Agentive
cook Animate
; O
there O
were UnboundedEvent
two Property
or O
three Property
colored Property
maids Animate
employed Agentive
there Property
. O
Wilson Animate
was O
told Mental
that O
it O
was UnboundedEvent
a O
sort Mental
of O
hotel Object
for O
white Animate
people Object
, O
which O
seemed Mental
to O
him O
rather Property
queer Property
. O
Why O
should O
a O
white Property
hotel Object
be O
set_down UnboundedEvent
in O
the O
center Object
of O
Black_Bottom Object
? O
But O
nevertheless Property
it O
looked Mental
respectable Property
. O
He O
was UnboundedEvent
glad Property
to O
have Mental
it O
there Property
. O
The O
rest UnboundedEvent
of O
Black_Bottom Object
was UnboundedEvent
a O
rabbit_warren Object
of O
homes Object
in O
every O
condition UnboundedEvent
of O
neglect UnboundedEvent
, O
disrepair UnboundedEvent
and O
careful Property
upkeep Agentive
. O
Dives Object
, O
carefully Property
repaired Property
huts Object
, O
and O
nicely Property
painted Property
and O
ornamented Property
cottages Object
were O
jumbled Property
together Property
cheek_by_jowl Property
with O
little Property
distinction Mental
. O
The O
best Property
could O
not Property
escape_from BoundedEvent
the O
worst Property
and O
the O
worst Property
nestled UnboundedEvent
cosily Property
beside O
the O
better Property
. O
The O
yards Object
, O
front Property
and O
back Property
, O
were UnboundedEvent
narrow Property
; O
some O
were UnboundedEvent
trash_dumps Object
, O
some O
had UnboundedEvent
flower_gardens Object
. O
Behind O
were UnboundedEvent
privies Object
, O
for O
there O
was UnboundedEvent
no O
sewage_system Object
. O
After O
looking Mental
about Property
a_bit Property
, O
Wilson Animate
discovered Mental
beyond O
Black_Bottom Object
, O
across O
the O
river Object
and O
far Property
removed Property
from O
the O
white Animate
city Object
, O
a O
considerable Property
tract Object
of O
land Object
, O
and O
it O
occurred Mental
to O
him O
that O
the O
church Object
and O
the O
better Property
Negro Animate
homes Object
might O
gradually Property
be O
moved BoundedEvent
to O
this O
plot Mental
. O
He O
talked_about Mental
it O
to O
the O
Presiding_Elder Animate
. O
The O
Presiding_Elder Animate
looked Mental
him O
over O
rather Property
carefully Property
. O
He O
was UnboundedEvent
not Property
sure Property
what O
kind Mental
of O
a O
man Animate
he O
had Mental
in_hand Property
. O
But O
there O
was UnboundedEvent
one Property
thing Mental
that O
he O
had_to O
stress Mental
, O
and O
that O
was UnboundedEvent
that O
the O
contribution Agentive
to O
the O
general Property
church Object
expenses Dynamic+Possession
, O
the O
dollar Mental
money Dynamic+Possession
, O
had O
been O
seriously Property
falling_behind Agentive
in O
this O
church Object
, O
and O
that O
must O
be O
looked_after Mental
immediately Property
. O
In_fact Property
, O
he O
intimated Mental
clearly Property
that O
that O
was UnboundedEvent
the O
reason Mental
that O
Wilson Animate
had O
been O
sent BoundedEvent
here Property
- O
to O
make Agentive
a O
larger Property
contribution Agentive
of O
dollar Mental
money Dynamic+Possession
. O
Wilson Animate
stressed Mental
the O
fact Mental
that O
clear Property
as O
this O
was UnboundedEvent
, O
they O
must O
have Mental
a O
better Property
church Object
, O
a O
more Property
business-like Property
conduct Property
of O
the O
church Object
organization Object
, O
and O
an O
effort Agentive
to O
get UnboundedEvent
this O
religious Property
center Object
out_of O
its O
rut Agentive
of O
wild Property
worship Agentive
into O
a O
modern Property
church Object
organization Object
. O
He O
emphasized Mental
to O
the O
Presiding_Elder Animate
the O
plan Mental
of O
giving_up Mental
the O
old Property
church Object
and O
moving BoundedEvent
across O
the O
river Object
. O
The O
Presiding_Elder Animate
was UnboundedEvent
sure Property
that O
that O
would O
be UnboundedEvent
impossible Property
. O
But O
he O
told Mental
Wilson Animate
to O
`` O
go_ahead Mental
and O
try Agentive
'' O
. O
And O
Wilson Animate
tried Agentive
. O
It O
did O
seem Mental
impossible Property
. O
The O
bank Object
which O
held Mental
the O
mortgage Dynamic+Possession
on O
the O
old Property
church Object
declared Mental
that O
the O
interest Dynamic+Possession
was UnboundedEvent
considerably Property
in_arrears Property
, O
and O
the O
real_estate Dynamic+Possession
people Object
said Mental
flatly Property
that O
the O
land Dynamic+Possession
across O
the O
river Object
was O
being O
held Mental
for O
an O
eventual Property
development Object
for O
white Animate
working Property
people Object
who O
were O
coming_in BoundedEvent
, O
and O
that O
none O
would O
be O
sold Mental
to O
colored Property
folk Object
. O
When O
it O
was O
proposed Mental
to O
rebuild Agentive
the O
church Object
, O
Wilson Animate
found Mental
that O
the O
terms Dynamic+Possession
for O
a O
new Property
mortgage Dynamic+Possession
were UnboundedEvent
very Property
high Property
. O
He O
was UnboundedEvent
sure Property
that O
he O
could O
do UnboundedEvent
better Property
if O
he O
went_to BoundedEvent
Atlanta Object
to O
get BoundedEvent
the O
deal Agentive
financed Mental
. O
But O
when O
this O
proposal Mental
was O
made Agentive
to O
his O
Deacon_Board Object
, O
he O
met BoundedEvent
unanimous Property
opposition Agentive
. O
The O
church Object
certainly Property
would O
not Property
be O
removed BoundedEvent
. O
The O
very Property
proposition Mental
was UnboundedEvent
sacrilege Agentive
. O
It O
had O
been UnboundedEvent
here Property
fifty Property
years Mental
. O
It O
was O
going_to O
stay BoundedEvent
forever Property
. O
It O
was UnboundedEvent
hardly Property
possible Property
to O
get BoundedEvent
any O
argument Mental
on O
the O
subject Mental
. O
As O
for O
rebuilding Agentive
, O
well O
, O
that O
might O
be O
looked_into Mental
, O
but O
there O
was UnboundedEvent
no O
hurry UnboundedEvent
, O
no O
hurry UnboundedEvent
at_all Property
. O
Wilson Animate
again Property
went BoundedEvent
downtown Object
to O
a O
different Property
banker Animate
, O
an O
intelligent Property
young Property
white_man Animate
who O
seemed Mental
rather Property
sympathetic Property
, O
but O
he O
shook BoundedEvent
his O
head Object
. O
`` O
Reverend Animate
'' O
, O
he O
said Mental
, O
`` O
I O
think Mental
you O
do O
n't Property
quite Property
understand Mental
the O
situation UnboundedEvent
here Property
. O
Do O
n't Property
you O
see Mental
the O
amount_of_money Dynamic+Possession
that O
has O
been O
invested Mental
by O
whites Animate
around O
that O
church Object
? O
Tenements Object
, O

, O
saloons Object
, O
some O

, O
I O
hope Mental
not Property
too_much Property
. O
The O
colored Property
people Object
are O
getting Mental
employment Agentive
at O
Kent_House Object
and O
other Property
places Object
, O
and O
they O
are UnboundedEvent
near Property
their O
places Object
of O

When O
a O
city Object
has O
arranged Mental
things UnboundedEvent
like O
this O
you O
cannot O
easily Property
change BoundedEvent
them O
. O
Now O
, O
if O
I O
were UnboundedEvent
you O
I O
would O
just Property
plan Agentive
to O
repair Agentive
the O
old Property
church Object
so Property
it O
would O
last UnboundedEvent
for O
five Property
or O
ten Property
years Mental
. O
By O
that O
time BoundedEvent
, O
perhaps Property
something O
better Property
can O
be O
done Agentive
'' O
. O
Then Property
Wilson Animate
asked Mental
, O
`` O
What O
about O
this O
Kent_House Object
which O
you O
mention Mental
? O
I O
do O
n't Property
understand Mental
why O
a O

should O
be UnboundedEvent
down Property
here Property
'' O
. O
The O
young Property
banker Animate
looked Mental
at O
him O
with O
a O
certain Property
surprise Mental
, O
and O
then Property
he O
said Mental
flatly Property
: O
`` O
I'm O

Hope Mental

. O
And O
he O
dismissed Agentive
the O

It O
was O
next Property
day Mental
that O
Sojourner Animate
came BoundedEvent

sat BoundedEvent
beside O
him O

took UnboundedEvent
his O

She O
said Mental

`` O

? O
`` O

said Mental
Wilson Animate
, O
`` O
I O

I O

`` O

Wilson Animate

`` O

you O

. O
`` O
Talk Mental

she O
said Mental

And O
after O
Wilson Animate

talked Mental
to O
Mrs._Catt Animate

to O

, O
he O
was UnboundedEvent
absolutely Property
amazed Property

This O
, O
of_course Property

was UnboundedEvent
the O

But O
it O

through O

on_the_part_of O
the O
Negroes Animate
as O
they O
became BoundedEvent
more Property

got Mental
better Property

But O
this O
situation UnboundedEvent

Kent_House Object

more Property
subtle Property

The O
wages Dynamic+Possession

The O

The O

there O

Good Property

And O
yet Property
Wilson Animate

that O

And O
for O
him O

the O

Payne Animate

He O

The O

Dr._Verdi Animate

Secretary_of_State Animate

A O

Payne Animate

In O

Above O

He O
explained Mental

without O

for O

he O

He O

He O
clattered Mental

out O

Somewhere Property

the O

Herold Animate

Well O

one O
did O

Herold Animate

He O
unhitched UnboundedEvent
his O

walked BoundedEvent

and O
spurred UnboundedEvent

The O
nigger Animate

Then Property
the O

He O
rode BoundedEvent

on Property

He O
had Mental
no O
idea Mental
where O

After O
some Property

he O
came BoundedEvent
to O
an O

An O
open Property
field Object
was UnboundedEvent
better Property
than O
a O

that O

for_sure Property

so O
he O
dismounted BoundedEvent

turned BoundedEvent
off O
the O
horse Animate

and O
plunged UnboundedEvent
through O
the O
grass Plant

He O
felt BoundedEvent
curiously Property
sleepy Property
, O
the O
world Object
seemed Mental
far Property
away Property

he O
knew Mental
he O
should O

Cap Animate

but O
he O
did O

He O

So O
choosing Mental

he O
clambered BoundedEvent
up Property

found Mental
a O
comfortable Property
notch Property

curled_up Property

like O
the O
tousled Property

he O

with O
his O

his O

as O
though O

Violence Agentive
always Property
made BoundedEvent

he O

In O

Edwin_Booth Animate

It O

familiar Property

him O
that O
he O
did O

Acting Agentive

On O
a O

tonight Property

They O

Laura_Keene Animate

Duclos Animate

that O

Duclos Animate

saw Agentive

`` O
Let Agentive

now Property
what O

He O

He O

a O
look Property

He O

without O

Soon Property
he O
was UnboundedEvent
ready Property

go Agentive

a O
three-dimensional_figure Property

Here Property
he O

When O

he O
added BoundedEvent

Next Property

there O

a O
similarity Property

He O

Yet O
he O

they O

The O

he O

Argiento Animate

The O

Though O
the O

I O

I O

Before O

Pat Animate
saw_to_it Mental

I O

a O

Pat Animate

A O

Most O

It O

the O

They O

reason Mental

For O

With O

perhaps Property

that O

He O

His O

at O
the O

quite Property
as O

he O

a O
Christian Animate

Rector Animate
was UnboundedEvent
often Property
curious Property

often Property
tempted Mental

questions Mental
but O
he O
never Property
did O
. O
If O

when O
Hino Animate

tell Mental
him O
about O

he O
would O
do O
so O

Rector Animate

no Property

that O
Hino Animate

When O

on O
the O
day Mental
after O
Hino Animate

down Property
to O
the O

Rector Animate
had Mental
a O
hunch Mental
it O

Hino Animate
with O
some Property
morsel Mental

too Property
important Property
to O

it O

He O
was UnboundedEvent
surprised Property
to O
find Mental
Kayabashi Animate

secretary Animate
on O
the O
other Property
end Object
of O
the O

. O
He O
was UnboundedEvent
even Property
more Property
startled Property
when O
he O
heard Mental
what O
Kayabashi Animate
wanted Mental
. O
The O
oyabun Animate
was O
entertaining Agentive
a O
group Object
of O
dignitaries Animate
, O
the O
secretary Animate

, O
businessmen Animate
from O
Tokyo Object
for_the_most_part Property

and O
Kayabashi Animate
wished O
to O
show Mental

the O

They O
had O
never Property

one O

and O
had O
expressed Mental
a O

about O

`` O
Oh O

? O
Rector Animate

`` O
I O
guess Mental
it O

When O
would O
the O

his O

up_here Property
'' O
? O
`` O
This O
afternoon Mental
'' O
, O
the O

`` O
At O

`` O
All_right Property

Rector Animate

`` O
I O

He O
was O
about_to O
hang_up UnboundedEvent
the O

but O
a O
note Mental
of O
hesitancy Mental
in O
the O
secretary Animate

voice Mental
left UnboundedEvent
the O
conversation Mental
open Property
. O
He O
had Mental
something O
more Property
to O
say Mental
. O
`` O
I O
beg Mental
to O
inquire Mental
if O
the O

safe Property

, O
he O
said Mental
. O
Rector Animate
laughed BoundedEvent
despite O
himself O
. O
`` O
Unless O
the O
oyabun Animate
has O
been O
working_on Agentive
it O

, O
he O
said Mental
, O
then Property
checked BoundedEvent
himself O
and O
added Mental
: O
`` O
You O
can O
tell Mental
Kayabashi-san Animate
that O

`` O
Arigato O

The O
secretary Animate
sighed BoundedEvent
with O
relief Mental
and_then Property
the O
telephone Object
clicked BoundedEvent
in O
Rector Animate

hand Object
. O
Rector Animate
had Mental
no Property
idea Mental
why O
Kayabashi Animate
wanted Mental
to O
visit Agentive
the O
mission Object

For O
the O
oyabun Animate
to O
make Agentive
such Property
a O
trip Agentive
was UnboundedEvent
either O
a O
sign Mental
of O
great Property
weakness Property

an O
indication Mental

equally Property
great Property
confidence UnboundedEvent
, O
and O
from O
all Property
the O
available Property

it O
was UnboundedEvent
probably Property
the O

Kayabashi Animate
must O
feel Mental
fairly Property
certain Property

his O
victory BoundedEvent

to O
make Agentive
a O

this O
, O
a O
trip Agentive
which O
could O
be O
so Property
easily Property
misinterpreted Mental
by O
the O
people Object
in O
the O
village Object
. O
At_the_same_time O
, O
it O
was UnboundedEvent
unlikely Property
that O
any O
businessmen Animate
would O
spend UnboundedEvent
a O
day Mental
in O
a O
Christian Property
mission Object
out_of O
mere Property
curiosity Mental
. O
No O
, O
Kayabashi Animate

bringing BoundedEvent

a O

Rector Animate
would O
not Property

they O
arrived BoundedEvent

When O
he O

given Mental
the O

a_few Property

he O
went_into BoundedEvent
the O

Mrs._Yamata Animate

Fujimoto Animate

a O

Rector Animate
asked Mental
him O

he O
wanted Mental

A O

He O
went_into BoundedEvent
the O

where O
Fletcher Animate

`` O

the O

Fletcher Animate

said Mental
he O
would O

Rector Animate

next Property

at O
the O

He O
beckoned Mental
to O
her O

she O
slipped BoundedEvent
quietly Property
outside Property

He O
told Mental
her O

his O

`` O

As O

Johnson Animate

warming_to Mental

by O

It O

all_in_all Property

He O

that O

really Property
beside O

He O

He O
found Mental
Elizabeth Animate

asked Mental

everything O

Then Property
Rector Animate

The O
fish Animate

He O

he O

when O

She O

She O

he O

I O

in_a_moment Property
she O

Lucretia Animate

She O
went_into BoundedEvent

She O
knew Mental
she O
was O
feeling Mental

inwardly Property

They O
were UnboundedEvent
both O
so Property
young Property

after_all Property

so Property

. O
How O
could O
it O
have O
been UnboundedEvent
thirty Property
years Mental
already Property
, O
she O
wondered Mental
? O
But O
yes O
, O
nineteen Mental
plus O
thirty Mental
was UnboundedEvent
forty-nine O
, O
and O
she O
was UnboundedEvent
forty-nine O
and O
she O
had O
been O
married Agentive
at O
nineteen Mental
. O
She O
stood_still BoundedEvent
over O
the O
leg_of_lamb Object

rubbing UnboundedEvent

, O
quite Property
suddenly Property
conscious Property

a O

a O
feeling Mental

wrath Mental
, O
a O
sensation Mental
of O
violence Agentive
that O
started BoundedEvent
her O
shivering UnboundedEvent
. O
But O
they O
all O
said Mental
, O
`` O
No O
, O
your O
time BoundedEvent
will O
come BoundedEvent
. O
Enjoy Mental
being UnboundedEvent
a O
bride Animate
while O
you O
can O
'' O
. O
There O
was UnboundedEvent
no O
room Mental
for O
company Animate
in O
the O
tiny Property
Weaning_House O
( O
where O
the O
Albright Animate
boys Animate
always Property
took BoundedEvent
their O

, O
till O
they O
could O
get Mental
a O
house Object
and O
a O

of O
their O

) O
. O
So O
when O
the O
Big_House O
filled_up BoundedEvent
and O
ran_over BoundedEvent
, O
the O
sisters-in-law Animate
found Mental
beds Object
for O
everyone O

their O

. O
And O
there O
was UnboundedEvent
still Property
not Property
anything O
that O
Linda_Kay Animate
could O
do Agentive

So O
Linda_Kay Animate
gave_up Agentive
asking Mental
, O
and O
accepted Mental
her O
reprieve UnboundedEvent
. O
Without O
saying Mental
so O
, O
she O
was UnboundedEvent
really Property
grateful Property
; O
for O
to O
attend Agentive
the O
dying Property
was UnboundedEvent
something O
she O
had O
never Property
experienced Mental
, O
and O
certainly Property
had O
not Property
imagined Agentive
when O
she O
thought_of Mental
the O
duties Agentive
she O
would O
have Mental
as O
Bobby_Joe Animate

wife Animate
. O
She O
had O
made Agentive
curtains Object
for O
all Property
the O
windows Object
of O
her O
little Property
house Object
, O
and O
she O
had O
kept UnboundedEvent
it O
spotless Property
and O
neat Property
, O
shabby Property
as O
it O
was UnboundedEvent
, O
and O
cooked BoundedEvent
good Property
meals Object
for O
Bobby_Joe Animate
. O
She O
had O
done Agentive
all Property
the O
things Agentive
she O
had O
promised Mental
herself O
she O
would O
do Agentive
, O
but O
she O
had O
not Property
thought_of Mental
this O
. O
People Object
died BoundedEvent
, O
she O
would O
have O
said Mental
, O
in O
hospitals Object
, O
or O
in O
cars Object
on O
the O
highway Object
at O
night Mental
. O
Bobby_Joe Animate
was UnboundedEvent
gone Property
all O
day Mental
now Property
, O
not Property
coming_in BoundedEvent
for O
dinner Object
and O
sometimes Property
not Property
for O
supper Object
. O
When O
they O
first Property
married Agentive
he O
had O
been O
working Agentive
in O
the O
fields Object
all O
day Mental
, O
and O
she O
would O
get_in BoundedEvent
the O
car Object
and O
drive BoundedEvent
to O
wherever O
he O
was O
working Agentive
, O
to O
take BoundedEvent
him O
a O
fresh Property
hot Property
meal Object
. O
Now Mental
there O
was UnboundedEvent
no O
work Agentive
in O
the O
fields Object
, O
nor O
would O
there O
be UnboundedEvent
till O
it O
rained BoundedEvent
, O
and O
she O
did O
not Property
know Mental
where O
he O
went BoundedEvent
. O
Not Property
that O
she O
complained Mental
, O
or O
had Mental
any O
cause Mental
to O
. O
Four Mental
or O
five Mental
of O
the O
cousins Animate
from O
East_Texas Object
were UnboundedEvent
about Property
his O
age Property
, O
so O
naturally Property
they O
ran_around BoundedEvent
together Property
. O
There O
was UnboundedEvent
no O
reason Mental
for O
her O
to O
ask Mental
what O
they O
did Agentive
. O
Thus Property
a O
new Property
pattern Agentive
of O
days Mental
began BoundedEvent
to O
develop BoundedEvent
, O
for O
Granny_Albright Animate
did O
not Property
die BoundedEvent
. O
She O
lay UnboundedEvent
still Property
on O
the O
bed Object
, O
her O
head Object
hardly Property
denting UnboundedEvent
the O
pillow Object
; O
sometimes Property
she O
opened UnboundedEvent
her O
eyes Object
and O
looked_around Mental
, O
and O
sometimes Property
she O
took Agentive
a_little Property
milk Object
or O
soup Object
. O
They O
stopped UnboundedEvent
expecting Mental
her O
to O
die BoundedEvent
the O
next Property
minute Mental
, O
but O
only Property
in O
the O
next Property
day Mental
or O
two Property
. O
Those O
who O
had O
driven BoundedEvent
hundreds Mental
of O
miles Mental
for O
the O
burial BoundedEvent
would O
not Property
go_home BoundedEvent
, O
for O
she O
might O
die BoundedEvent
any O
time BoundedEvent
; O
but O
they O
might O
as_well Property
unpack UnboundedEvent
their O
suitcases Object
, O
for O
she O
might O
linger UnboundedEvent
on O
. O
So O
the O
pattern Agentive
was O
established Agentive
. O
When O
Linda_Kay Animate
had O
put_up UnboundedEvent
her O
breakfast Object
dishes Object
and O
mopped UnboundedEvent
her O
linoleum Object
rugs Object
, O
she O
would O
go_to BoundedEvent
the O
Big_House O
. O
There O
was UnboundedEvent
not Property
anything O
she O
could O
do Agentive
there Property
, O
but O
that O
was UnboundedEvent
where O
everyone O
was UnboundedEvent
, O
or O
would O
be UnboundedEvent
. O
Bobby_Joe Animate
and O
the O
boys Animate
would O
come_by Agentive
, O
say Mental
`` O
How O
's O
Granny Animate
'' O
? O
and O
sit UnboundedEvent
on O
the O
porch Object
a O
while Mental
. O
The O
older Property
men Animate
would O
be UnboundedEvent
there Property
at O
noon Mental
, O
and O
maybe Property
rest BoundedEvent
for O
a O
time Mental
before O
they O
took BoundedEvent
their O
guns Object
off Property
to O
the O
creek Object
or O
drove BoundedEvent
down Property
the O
road Object
towards O
town Object
. O
The O
women Animate
and O
children Animate
stayed_at UnboundedEvent
the O
Albrights Animate
' O
. O
The O
women Animate
, O
keeping UnboundedEvent
their O
voices Mental
low Property
as O
they O
worked Agentive
around O
the O
house Object
or O
sat UnboundedEvent
in O
the O
living_room Object
, O
sounded Mental
like O
chickens Object
shut_up Property
in O
a O
coop Object
for O
the O
night Mental
. O
The O
children Animate
had O
to O
play Agentive
away Property
from O
the O
house Object
( O
in O
the O
barn Object
loft Object
or O
the O
pasture Object
behind O
the O
barn Object
) O
, O
to O
maintain UnboundedEvent
a O
proper Property
quietness Mental
. O
Off_and_on Property
, O
all O
day Mental
, O
someone Animate
would O
be O
wiping UnboundedEvent
at O
the O
powdery Property
gray Property
dust Object
that O
settled BoundedEvent
over O
everything O
. O
The O
evaporative_cooler Object
had O
been O
moved BoundedEvent
to O
Granny Animate
's O
room Object
, O
and O
her O
door Object
was O
kept UnboundedEvent
shut UnboundedEvent
; O
so Property
that O
the O
rest UnboundedEvent
of O
the O
house Object
stayed BoundedEvent
open Property
, O
though O
there O
was UnboundedEvent
a O
question Mental
as O
to O
whether O
it O
was UnboundedEvent
hotter Property
or O
cooler Property
that O
way Property
. O
The O
dust Object
clogged UnboundedEvent
their O
throats Object
, O
and O
the O
heat Mental
parched BoundedEvent
them O
, O
so O
that O
the O
women Animate
were UnboundedEvent
always Property
making Agentive
ice_water Object
. O
They O
had O
cleaned_up BoundedEvent
an O
old Property
ice_box Object
and O
begun BoundedEvent
to O
buy Mental
fifty Property
pound Mental
blocks Property
of O
ice Object
in O
town Object
, O
as O
the O
electric_refrigerator Object
came Agentive
nowhere Property
near O
providing Mental
enough Property
ice Object
for O
the O
crowds Object
who O
ate Agentive
and O
drank Agentive
there Property
. O
One Property
afternoon Mental
, O
as O
the O
women Animate
sat UnboundedEvent
clucking Mental
softly Property
, O
a O
new Property
carload Object
of O
people Object
pulled_up BoundedEvent
at O
the O

. O
It O
was UnboundedEvent
a O
Cadillac O
, O
black Property
grayed Property
with O
the O
dust Object
of O
the O
road Object
, O
its O

closed Property
tight Property
so O
you O
knew Mental
that O
the O
people Object
who O
climbed BoundedEvent
out Property
of_it O
would O
be UnboundedEvent
cool Property
and O
unwrinkled Property
. O
They O
were UnboundedEvent
an O

Linda_Kay Animate

a O

Siddo O

And O
, O
from O
the O

he O
faced Agentive

difficult Property

The O
expedition Agentive

succeeded Agentive
in O
correlating UnboundedEvent
two Property

American Property

The O
description Mental

the O
Siddo O

very Property
restricted Property

And O
, O
as O
Hal Animate
found_out Mental
, O
obviously Property
mistaken Property

many Property
cases BoundedEvent

This O
discovery Mental
caused Agentive
Hal Animate
anxiety Mental
. O
His O
duty Agentive

to O
write Agentive
a O
school_text Mental

to O
teach Mental
the O
entire Property

of O
the O
Gabriel O
how O
to O

Ozagen O
. O
Yet O
, O
if O
he O
used Agentive
all_of Property
the O
little Property

, O
he O
would O
be O
instructing Mental

wrongly Property

Moreover Property
, O
even Property

would O
be UnboundedEvent
difficult Property
. O
For_one_thing Property
, O
the O
organs Object
of O

of O
the O
Ozagen O
natives Animate
differed UnboundedEvent
somewhat Property
from O
Earthmen Animate

; O
the O
sounds Physical
made Agentive
by O
these O

, O
therefore Property
, O
dissimilar Property

It O
was O
true Property
that O
they O
could O
be O
approximated UnboundedEvent

but O
would O
the O
Ozagenians O
understand Mental
these O
approximations Property
? O
Another O
obstacle Mental
was UnboundedEvent
the O
grammatical Property
construction Mental
of O
Siddo O
. O
Consider Mental
the O
tense_system Mental

Instead Property
of O
inflecting Mental
a O
verb Mental

using Agentive
an O

particle Mental

the O
past Mental
or O
future Mental
, O
Siddo O
used Agentive
an O
entirely Property
different Property
word Mental
. O
Thus Property
, O
the O
masculine Property
animate Property
infinitive Mental
dabhumaksanigalu'ahai O
, O
meaning Mental
to O
live O
, O
was UnboundedEvent
, O
in O
the O
perfect_tense UnboundedEvent

ksu'u'peli'afo O
, O
and O
, O
in O
the O
future Mental
, O
mai'teipa O
. O
The O
same Property
use Agentive
of O
an O
entirely Property
different Property
word Mental
applied UnboundedEvent
for O
all Property
the O
other Property
tenses Mental
. O
Plus O
the O
fact Mental
that O
Siddo O
not_only Property
had UnboundedEvent
the O
normal Property
( O
to O
Earthmen Animate
) O
three Property
genders Mental
of O
masculine Property
, O
feminine Property

and O
neuter Mental
, O
but O
the O
two Property
extra Property
of O
inanimate Property

spiritual Property
. O
Fortunately Property
, O
gender Mental
was UnboundedEvent
inflected Property
, O
though O
the O

be UnboundedEvent
difficult Property
for O
anybody O

One Property
day Mental

the O

They O
wanted Mental

see Mental
what O
his O

the O
General Animate

He O
looked Mental
so Property
comfortable Property
being UnboundedEvent
straight Property
. O
They O
wanted Mental
to O
touch Mental
the O
mystery Mental
. O
Arlene Animate
was O
boosting BoundedEvent
them O
up Property
when O
the O
policeman Animate
came_by Agentive
. O
He O
was UnboundedEvent
very Property
rude Property

Arlene Animate
had UnboundedEvent
a O
hard Property

too Property

this O
time BoundedEvent

The O
policeman Animate

rather Property
popped BoundedEvent
for O
a O
second Mental

but O
then Property
Arlene Animate
got Mental
another O
tone Mental
in O
a O
hurry UnboundedEvent
, O
and O
she O
said Mental
, O
`` O
If O
it O

these O

- O
. O
The O
policeman Animate

a O
confused Property

funny Property

he O

But O
this O

it O

a O

ordinance Mental
that O
the O

. O
Arlene Animate
was UnboundedEvent
so Property
ashamed Property
that O
she O
hung BoundedEvent
her O
head Object
when O
she O
said Mental
, O
`` O
Yes O
, O
sir O
'' O
. O
The O
policeman Animate
walked BoundedEvent
on Property
, O
but O
he O
looked_back Mental
once Property

That O
had O
happened BoundedEvent
on O
the O
day Mental
when O
two Property

unusual Property
things BoundedEvent

occurred BoundedEvent

Arlene Animate
had O
taught Mental

a O

way Agentive

fun Agentive
in O
their O

and O
they O

told Mental

In O
matters Mental
of O
exact Property
information Mental
, O
that O
kept UnboundedEvent
her O
one Property

and O
so O
they O
were UnboundedEvent
consistently Property
true Property

principles Mental

`` O
Never_mind_'' O
, O
Arlene Animate

after O

`` O

asked Mental
the O
children Animate

whose O
reflexes Agentive

were UnboundedEvent
invariably Property
so Property
admirably Property
normal Property

predictable Property

Maybe Property
that O

why O
they O

cordial Property

of O
Arlene Animate

`` O

Arlene Animate

echoing Mental
the O

a O

And O
when O
they O

they O

a O

First Property

Arlene Animate

They O

`` O
Just O

, O
said Mental
Arlene Animate
again Property

as O

discovering Mental
the O
pleasantly Property

`` O

`` O

One Mental

Those O

She O

But O
not Property

Just Property

enough Property

`` O

said Mental
Arlene Animate

eventually Property

making Mental

Their O

`` O
Arlene Animate

my O

said Mental
it O
too_soon Property

my O

lifted BoundedEvent
slightly Property

She O
was O
biting UnboundedEvent

a O

she O

somewhat Property
under O

the O

she O

It O
never Property
worked Agentive

naturally Property

it O
made BoundedEvent
her O
look Mental
unusual Property

Also Property
, O
when O
she O
had O
bitten_off UnboundedEvent
half Mental

the O

she O
found Mental
the O
suspense Mental

she O

it O

Then Property

my O

her O

In O

In O

the O
problem UnboundedEvent

one O
of O

High Property

he O

at_least Property

Undoubtedly Property

can O
be O
done Agentive

in O

However O
, O
the O

the O

the O
fact Mental

This O
is UnboundedEvent
not Property
due_to Property
any O
policy Mental

Northern Property

Quite Property
the O
contrary UnboundedEvent
, O
as O
I O
can O
testify Mental
from O
personal Property

as O
a O
former Property

Rather Property
we O
see Mental
here Property
another O

The O
absence UnboundedEvent

I O
believe Mental
the O
situation UnboundedEvent

but O
the O
success Agentive

need_to O

Here Property
again Property
we O
run_into UnboundedEvent
the O
roadblock Mental
that O

do O
not Property
like Mental
to O
be O
designated Mental
as O
Negroes Animate
in O

. O
How O
can O
the O

be O
broken BoundedEvent
? O
This O
is UnboundedEvent
a O
problem UnboundedEvent
to O
which O
leaders Animate
of O
opinion Mental
, O
both O
Negro Animate

white Animate
, O
should O
devote Mental

more Property

It O

in O

I O
should_like O
to O
underline Mental
four Property
points Mental
I O
made O
in O
my O
first Property
report Mental
with O
respect_to UnboundedEvent
vocational Property
education Agentive
. O
First_and_foremost Property
, O
vocational Property
courses Agentive
should O
not Property
replace Agentive
courses Agentive
which O
are UnboundedEvent
essential Property
parts UnboundedEvent
of O
the O
required Property
academic_program Mental
for O

. O
Second Property
, O
vocational Property
courses Agentive
should O
be O
provided Mental
in O
grades Object
11 O
and O
12 O
and O
not Property
require UnboundedEvent
more_than Property
half Mental
the O
student Animate

time Mental
in O
those O
years Mental
; O
however Property
, O
for O
slow Property
learners Animate
and O
prospective Property
dropouts Animate
these O
courses Agentive
ought_to O
begin UnboundedEvent
earlier Property
. O
Third Property
, O
the O
significance Property
of O
the O
vocational Property
courses Agentive
is UnboundedEvent
that O
those O
enrolled Property
are UnboundedEvent
keenly Property
interested Property
in O
the O
work Mental
; O
they O
realize Mental
the O
relevance UnboundedEvent
of O
what O
they O
are O
learning Mental
to O
their O
future Property
careers Agentive
, O
and O
this O
sense Mental
of O
purpose Property
is O
carried_over BoundedEvent
to O
the O
academic Property
courses Agentive
which O
they O
are O
studying Mental
at_the_same_time Property
. O
Fourth Property
, O
the O
type Mental
of O
vocational Property
training_programs Mental
should O
be O
related Property
to O
the O
employment Agentive
opportunities UnboundedEvent
in O
the O
general Property

This O
last Property
point Mental
is UnboundedEvent
important Property
because O

, O
if O
any O
, O

have O
chosen Mental

a O

a O
consequence BoundedEvent

the O
training Agentive
, O
the O
whole Property
idea Mental
of O

disappears BoundedEvent
. O
Vocational Property

which O
holds Mental
no O
hope Mental
that O
the O
skill Mental

will O
be UnboundedEvent
in_fact Property
a O

just Property
another O

for O
those O
whose O

Those O
who O
, O
because O
of O
population Object
mobility Property
and O
the O
reputed Property
desire Property
of O

their O
own Property
employees Animate
, O
would O
limit BoundedEvent
vocational Property

the O
importance Property
of O

I O
have O
been O
using Agentive
the O
word Mental
`` O

as O
a O
layman Animate
would O
at_first_sight Property
think Mental
it O
should O
be O
used Agentive

I O
intend Mental
to O
include Mental
under O
the O

all O
the O
practical Property
courses Agentive
open Property
to O
boys Animate

. O
These O
courses Agentive
develop BoundedEvent
skills Mental
other_than Property
those O
we O
think_of Mental
when O
we O
use Agentive
the O
adjective Mental
`` O

. O
Practically Property
all_of Property
these O
practical Property
skills Mental
are UnboundedEvent
of O
such Property
a O
nature Property
that O
a O
degree UnboundedEvent

mastery Mental
can O
be O
obtained Mental
in O
high_school Object
sufficient Property
to O
enable BoundedEvent
the O
youth Animate
to O

a O
job Agentive
at_once Property
on O
the O
basis UnboundedEvent
of O
the O

. O
They O
are UnboundedEvent
in O
this O
sense Mental
skills Mental

immediately Property
on O

from O
high_school Object
. O
To_be_sure Property
, O
in O
tool-and-die_work Agentive
and O
in O
the O
building Agentive
trades Agentive
, O
the O
first Property
job Agentive
must O
be UnboundedEvent
often Property
on O
an O

, O
but O
two Property
years Mental

. O
Similarly Property
, O
a O

Of_course Property
, O
it O
can O
be O

that O
an O

English Mental

the O

It O
is O
from O
this O
unpromising Property
background Property
that O
the O
fictional Property

recruited Mental
. O
The O
mythological Property
private_eye Animate
differs UnboundedEvent
from O
his O

in O

in O
two Property
essential Property
ways Property

On_the_one_hand Property
, O
he O
does O
not Property
work Agentive

a O
large Property

but O
is UnboundedEvent
almost Property

self-employed Property

As O
a O
free-lance Property

the O
fictional Property
detective Animate
is UnboundedEvent
responsible Property
to O
no O
one Animate

himself O
and O
his O
client Animate
. O
For O
this O
reason Mental
, O
he O
appears Mental
as O
an O
independent Property

self-reliant Property

whose O
rugged Property

pressed UnboundedEvent
into O
the O
mold Property
of O
a O
9 Property

routine Agentive
. O
On_the_other_hand Property
, O
the O
fictional Property
detective Animate
does O
not Property
break BoundedEvent
strikes Agentive
or O
handle Agentive
divorce Agentive
cases Agentive
; O
no O
client Animate
would O
ever Property
think_of Mental
asking Mental
him O

do Agentive
such Property
things Agentive

Whatever O
his O
original Property
assignment Agentive
, O
the O
fictional Property
private_eye Animate
ends_up BoundedEvent
by O
investigating Mental

solving Mental
a O
crime Agentive

usually Property
a O
murder Agentive

Operating UnboundedEvent
as O
a O
one_man Property

in O
fact UnboundedEvent
if O
not Property
in_name Property
, O
he O
is UnboundedEvent
at_once Property
more Property

more Property
dedicated Property
than O
the O
police Object
themselves O
. O
He O
catches UnboundedEvent
criminals Animate
not Property
merely Property
because O
he O
is O
paid Mental

do O
so Property
( O
frequently Property
he O
does O
not Property
receive Mental
a O
fee Dynamic+Possession
at_all Property

, O
but O
because O
he O
enjoys Mental
his O
work Agentive
, O
because O
he O
firmly Property
believes Mental
that O
murder Agentive

be O
punished Agentive
. O
Thus Property
the O
fictional Property

is UnboundedEvent
much Property
more_than Property
a O
simple Property
businessman Animate

He O
is UnboundedEvent
, O
first_and_foremost Property
, O
a O
defender Animate

It O
is O
this O
curious Property
blend BoundedEvent
of O
rugged Property
individualism Property

public Property
service Agentive
which O
accounts_for UnboundedEvent
the O
great Property
appeal Property
of O
the O

By_virtue_of O
his O
self-reliance UnboundedEvent
, O
his O
individualism Property
and O
his O
freedom UnboundedEvent
from O
external Property
restraint Agentive
, O
the O
private_eye Animate

a O
perfect Property
embodiment Animate
of O
the O
middle_class Object
conception Mental
of O

, O
which O
amounts UnboundedEvent
to O
doing Agentive
what O
you O
please Mental
and O
let_the_devil_take_the_hindmost O
. O
At_the_same_time Property
, O
because O
the O

the O

he O

In O
this O

the O

He O

In_short Property

the O

The O

Now O
, O
although O
the O

go_back UnboundedEvent

as O
Balzac Animate

it O

Thus Property
the O
transformation BoundedEvent

Adam_Smith Animate

not Property

The O

The O

it O

that O

This O
is UnboundedEvent
an O
unsolved Property
problem UnboundedEvent
which O
probably Property
has O
never Property
been O
seriously Property
investigated Mental
, O
although O
one O
frequently Property
hears Mental
the O
comment Mental
that O
we O
have Mental
insufficient Property
specialists Animate
of O
the O
kind Mental
who O
can O
compete Agentive
with O
the O
Germans Animate

, O
for_example Property
, O

the O

We O
hear Mental
equally Property

concern Mental

the O
belief Mental
that O
we O
have Mental
not Property
enough Property
generalists Animate
who O
can O
see Mental
the O
over-all Property
picture UnboundedEvent
and O
combine BoundedEvent
our O
national Property

for O
useful Property
purposes Property

This O
problem UnboundedEvent
of O
the O
optimum Property
balance UnboundedEvent
in O
the O
relative Property
numbers Property
of O
generalists Animate
and O
specialists Animate
can O
be O
investigated Mental
on O
a O
communicative Property
network Object
basis Mental
. O
Since O
the O
difficulty Property
of O
drawing Mental
the O
net Object
is UnboundedEvent
great Property
, O
we O
will O
merely Property
discuss Mental
it O
. O
First Property
, O
we O
realize Mental
that O
a O
pure Property
specialist Animate
does O
not Property
exist UnboundedEvent
. O
But O
, O
for O
practical Property
purposes Property
, O
we O
have Mental
people Object
who O
can O
be O
considered Mental
as O
such Property
. O
For_example Property
, O
there O
are UnboundedEvent
persons Animate
who O
are Agentive
in O
physical_science Mental
, O
in O
the O
field Mental
of O
mineralogy Mental
, O
trained Mental
in O
crystallography Mental
, O
who O
use Agentive
only Property
X-rays Physical
, O
applying Agentive
only Property
the O
powder_technique UnboundedEvent
of O
X-ray_diffraction Physical
, O
to O
clay Object

only Property
, O
and O
who O
have O
spent UnboundedEvent
the O
last Property
fifteen Property
years Mental
concentrating_on UnboundedEvent
the O
montmorillonites O

the O
lung Object

of O

So O
we O
see Mental
that O
a O

a O
man Animate
who O
knows Mental
more Property

more Property
about O
less Property

the O

who O
knows Mental
less Property

less Property

first Property
I O
want Mental

he O
found Mental

He O
points_out Mental

'' O

Let Agentive
me O
quote Mental

He O

I O
would O
further Property

another Property
the O

Its O

`` O

Adlai_Stevenson Animate

Only Property
Walter_Lippman Animate

the O

. O
But O
the O
most Property
notable Property
thing Mental
about O
the O
incantation Mental
of O
these O

was UnboundedEvent
that O
the O
one-time Property
shibboleth Mental

conspicuously Property
absent Property

The O
second Property
specific Property
comment Mental
was UnboundedEvent
the O
report Mental
of O
Eisenhower Animate

Commission_on_National_Goals O
, O
titled Property
Goals_For_Americans O

They O
, O
perhaps Property
, O
gave Mental
the O
pitch Mental

their O
position Mental
in O
the O
preface Mental
where O
it O
was O
said Mental
that O
Eisenhower Animate

that O
the O
Commission Object

administered Agentive

the O
American_Assembly_of_Columbia_University Object

because O
it O

The O
Commission Object
seems Mental

represent Mental
the O
viewpoint Mental

I O
would O
call Mental
the O
unconscious Property

not Property
unconscious Property
enough Property

to O
invoke Agentive
the O
now Property
taboo Property
symbolism Mental

And O
here Property
again Property
we O
hear Mental
the O

above O
: O
`` O
The O

it O

the O
need Object

let Agentive
me O
add Mental

Father_Murray Animate

too Property
, O
though O
I O
may O
add Mental

with O
considerably Property
more Property
historical Property

I O
will O
reserve Mental
discussion Mental
of_it O

a O
moment Mental

, O
to O
return Mental
to O

As O
symptomatic_of Property

he O

Does O
that O

And O
the O
basic Property
character Property

spiritual Property
rather Property

Ralph_Gabriel Animate
gave Mental
it O
the O
name Mental

But O
there O
's UnboundedEvent
a O
subjective Property
side Mental

Does O
our O

have Mental
a O
runaway Property

a O

Here Property
there O
may O
be UnboundedEvent
an O
analogy Property
with O

we O
can O
detect Mental

their O
rapidly Property

, O
determinable Property
only_when Property

the O

Should O
the O

then Property
warn Mental

? O
Noting Mental
such Property

the O

almost Property

One Property

whether O

we O

the O

Its O
pretense Agentive

little Property
more Property

a O

It O
serves Agentive

poorly Property

. O
As O
a O
creative Property

its O

primarily Property
in O
`` O

( O
an O

. O
As O
to O

to O

, O
it O
is UnboundedEvent
notorious Property
for O
its O
callous Property
disregard Agentive
except O
where O
it O
depends_on Mental
them O
for O

The O
corporation Object
in O
America Object
is UnboundedEvent
in_reality Property
our O
form Mental
of O
socialism Mental
, O
vying Agentive
in_a_sense Property
with O
the O
other Property
socialistic Property

that O
has O
emerged BoundedEvent
within O
governmental Property

But O
while O
the O
corporation Object
has Mental
all O
the O
disadvantages Property
of O
the O
socialist Property
form Mental
of O
organization Object
( O
so Property
cumbersome Property
it O
cannot O
constructively Property
do Agentive
much Property

anything O
not Property

with O
its O

perpetuate UnboundedEvent

, O
unluckily Property
it O
does O
not Property

the O

of O
socialism Mental
, O
the O
motivation Mental
to O
operate UnboundedEvent
for O
the O

of O
society Object
as_a_whole Property

So O
we O
are O
faced Mental
with O
a O
vast Property
network Object

amorphous Property

perpetuating UnboundedEvent

in O
whatever O
manner Property

without O

forcing Mental

a O

the O

The O
corporation Object
has Mental
a O
limited Property
, O
specific Property
place Mental
in O
our O

. O
Ideally Property
speaking Mental
, O
it O
should O
be O
allowed Mental
to O
operate UnboundedEvent
only Property
where O
the O
public Object
has Mental
a O
great Property
stake Dynamic+Possession
in O
the O
continuity UnboundedEvent
of O

or O

, O
and O
where O
the O
actions Agentive
of O
a O
single Property

are UnboundedEvent
secondary Property
to O
the O

of O

. O
Examples Mental
are UnboundedEvent
in O
public Property
utilities Object
, O
making Agentive
military Property
aircraft Object

, O
or O
where O
the O
investment Agentive

a O

would O
be UnboundedEvent
too Property
great Property
for O
a O
much Property

by_any_means Property
other_than Property
the O
corporate Property
form Mental
, O
e._g. Property
constructing Agentive
major Property

. O
Thus Property
, O
if O
corporations Object
are O
not Property
to O
run_away BoundedEvent
with O
us O
, O
they O
must O
become BoundedEvent
quasi Property

In O
all O
other Property
areas UnboundedEvent

`` O

Avoiding Agentive

be O
done Agentive
only Property
by O

for O
this O
human_beings Animate

Such Property

thus Property
establish Agentive

The O

the O

Leadership UnboundedEvent

lacking Property

because O
it O

Men Animate

In O

One O
might O

indeed Property

argue Mental
that O
the O

in_so_far Property

it O

We O

more Property

Thus Property
Burns Animate

On_the_other_hand Property

Arnold Animate

taken Mental

Understanding Mental
a O
work_of_art Object
involves UnboundedEvent
recognition UnboundedEvent
of O
the O
ideas Mental
that O
it O
reflects Mental

. O
Thus Property
the O
student Animate
of O
literature Mental
may O
sometimes Property
find Mental
it O
helpful Property
to O
classify Mental
a O
poem Mental

an O

in O
ideal Property

Again O
, O
he O
may O
discover Mental

a O

idea Mental
that O

been O
presented Mental
elsewhere Property
and O
at O
other Property
times Mental
in O
various Property
ways Property
. O
Our O
understanding Mental
will O
very Property
probably Property
require UnboundedEvent
both O
these O
commentaries Mental
. O
Very Property
likely Property
it O
will O
also Property
include UnboundedEvent
a O
recognition UnboundedEvent
that O
the O
work Object
we O
are O
reading Mental
reflects Mental
or O
`` O

'' O
some O
way Property

`` O

'' O
of O
ideas Mental
occurring UnboundedEvent

Thus Property
ideas Mental
like O
`` O

'' O
, O
`` O

and O
`` O

'' O
cluster BoundedEvent

Usually Property
the O

us O
a O
special Property

even Property
an O
individualized Property
rendering Mental

treatment Mental
of O
the O

so O
that O
the O

finds Mental
it O
necessary Property

distinguish Mental
carefully Property
between O
the O
several Property
expressions Mental
of O
an O
`` O

Accordingly Property
we O
may O
speak_of Mental
the O
Platonism Mental

Shelley Animate

the O
type Mental

Again O

In O

`` O

The O

Upon O

Petitioner Animate

But O
the O

of O
the O

attributing Mental
this O

petitioner Animate

He O

he O
could O

he O

asserting Mental

Apparently Property

Nevertheless Property

After O

This O
he O

We O
found Mental

that O

At O

Section Mental
6_(_j_) O
of O
the O
Act O
, O
as O
we O
have O
held Mental
, O
does O
require UnboundedEvent
the O
Department Object

to O
be O
placed UnboundedEvent
in O
a O
registrant Animate

. O
Gonzales_v._United_States O

But O
there O
is O
nothing Mental
in O
the O
Act O
requiring UnboundedEvent
the O

to O
be O
likewise Property
turned_over Mental

the O

While O
the O

formerly Property
required UnboundedEvent
that O
the O

be O
placed UnboundedEvent
in O
the O
registrant Animate

, O
this O
requirement Mental
was O
eliminated BoundedEvent
in O
1952 O
. O
Moreover Property
, O
the O
hearing_officer Animate

report Mental
is UnboundedEvent
but O
intradepartmental Property
, O
is O
directed Agentive
to O
the O
Attorney_General Animate

, O
of_course Property
, O
is UnboundedEvent
not Property
the O

of O
the O

It O
is UnboundedEvent
not Property
essentially Property
different Property
from O
a O
memorandum Mental
of O
an O

in O
the O
Department_of_Justice Object
, O
of O
which O
the O
Attorney_General Animate
receives Mental
many Property
, O
and O
to O
which O
he O
may O
give Mental

It O
is UnboundedEvent
but O
part UnboundedEvent
of O
the O
whole Property
process Agentive
within O
the O

that O
goes_into UnboundedEvent
the O
making Agentive
of O
the O
final Property
recommendation Mental
to O
the O

. O
It O
is UnboundedEvent
also Property
significant Property
that O
neither O
this O

nor O
the O

were O
furnished Mental
to O
the O

board Object
. O
Hence Property
the O
petitioner Animate
had Mental
full Property
opportunity UnboundedEvent
to O
traverse Mental
the O
only Property
conclusions Mental
of O
the O
Department Object
on O
file Mental
with O
the O
Board Object
. O
Petitioner Animate
knew Mental
that O
the O
Department Object

was O
based Mental
not Property
on O
the O
hearing_officer Animate

but O
on O
the O

in O

Having O
had Mental
every O
opportunity UnboundedEvent

rebut Mental
the O
finding Agentive
of O
the O
local Property
board Object
before O
both O
the O

and O
the O

, O
petitioner Animate
cannot O
now Property
claim Mental
that O
he O
was O
denied Mental
due_process Agentive
because O
he O
did O
not Property
succeed Agentive
. O
It O
appears Mental
to O
us O
that O
the O
same Property
reasoning Mental
applies UnboundedEvent
to O
the O
production Agentive
of O
the O

In_addition Property
, O
petitioner Animate
has O
failed Agentive

show Mental
any O

. O
While O
there O
are UnboundedEvent
now Property
allegations Mental
of O
the O
withholding Agentive
of O
`` O

at O
the O

'' O
and O
a O

of O
a O
`` O

, O
no O
such Property

was O
made Agentive
by O
petitioner Animate
at O
any O
stage UnboundedEvent
of O
the O
administrative Property
process Agentive
. O
Moreover Property
, O
his O
testimony Mental
at O

never Property
developed Mental
any O
such Property
facts Mental
. O
In O
the O
light Mental
of O
these O
circumstances Mental
, O
as_well Property
as O
the O
fact Mental
that O
the O
issue Mental
at O

in O
this O
respect Mental
centered UnboundedEvent
entirely Property
on O
the O
Department Object

, O
which O
petitioner Animate
repudiated Mental
but O
which O
both O
the O
appeal Agentive

and O
the O

below O
found Mental
supported UnboundedEvent
by O
the O

, O
we O
find Mental
no O
relevancy UnboundedEvent
in O
the O

Finally Property
petitioner Animate
says Mental
that O
he O
was O
entitled Property
to O
inspect Mental
the O
FBI Object
report Mental
during O
the O
proceedings Agentive
before O
the O

as_well Property
as O
at O

He O
did O
receive Mental
a O

it O
- O
the O
same Property
that O
was O
furnished Mental
the O

- O
and O
he O
made Agentive
no O
claim Mental
of O
its O
inaccuracy Property
. O
Even Property
now Property
no O
such Property

is O
asserted Mental
. O
He O
bases Mental
his O

contention Mental
on O
the O
general Property
right Property
to O
explore Mental
, O
indicating Mental
that O
he O
hopes Mental
to O
find Mental
some O
discrepancy Property
in O
the O
resume Mental
. O
But O
this O
is O
fully Property
answered Mental
by O
United_States_v._Nugent O

There O
we O
held Mental
`` O

Even Property
if O

petitioner Animate
here Property
would O
not Property

The O

the O

the O

was O

With O
this O
enlarged Property

I O
should_like O
to O
make Agentive
a_few Property

: O
What O
we O

do O
not Property
do Agentive
will O
make Agentive
a O
very Property
large Property

in O
what O

in O
the O

We O
in O
this O

think_about Mental
foreign_policy Mental

We O
cannot O
regard Mental

Foreign_policy Mental

the O
total Property
involvement Agentive

the O
American Property

. O
That O
means UnboundedEvent
that O
, O
if O
we O
are O
to O
achieve Agentive
a O
new Property
standard Mental
of O

, O
we O
must O
think Mental
in_terms_of Property
the O

It O

the O

I O

What O
I O

that O

we O

intentionally Property

not Property
through O

through O
bureaucratic Property

difficulties UnboundedEvent

I O
also Property
hope Mental
that O
we O
can O
do Agentive
something O
about O
reducing BoundedEvent
the O
infant_mortality_rate O
of O

- O
an O
affliction O
of O
all O
bureaucracies Object
. O
We O
want Mental
to O
stimulate Mental

from O
the O

the O

of O
the O

. O
We O
want Mental
to O
make BoundedEvent
sure Property
that O

realize Mental
that O

welcome Property
, O
that O

goes BoundedEvent
right Property
down O
to O
the O

and O
goes BoundedEvent
all_the_way Property
to O

. O
I O
hope Mental
no O
one O
expects Mental
that O
only Property
Presidential Property

are O
looked_upon Mental
as O

. O
The O

Further Property
, O
I O
would O
hope Mental

we O
could O

While O
observing Mental
the O
operations Agentive

various Property

I O
have O
felt Mental

in O
many Property

our O

good Property
we O
have O
tended UnboundedEvent

To O

a_few Property

The O

the O

perhaps Property
even Property

Chewing Mental

We O

In_the_first_place Property

it O

Mr._Truman Animate
emphasized Mental
this O

`` O
You O

This O

We O

asked Mental
them O

I O
doubt Mental

for_example Property

that O
, O
3 Property
