The O

Indeed O
their O

somewhat Property

We O
speculate Mental

under O

because O
of O
the O

that O

It O

note Mental

Our O
conjecture Mental

that O

The O
fact Mental
that O

thought Mental

a O
vital Property

the O

pattern Mental

failure Agentive

these O

The O
child Animate

high Property

may O
first Property
direct BoundedEvent
his O
anxiety UnboundedEvent
released Property

but O
because O
his O
distress Mental
severely Property
reduces BoundedEvent
the O
abilities Mental

, O
the O
child Animate

fail Agentive

the O

Failure Agentive

the O

the O
intensity Property

increased BoundedEvent

Success Agentive

By O

so_that O
the O
child Animate

At O

The O

We O
may O

his O

that O

The O
engineer Animate

We O
may O

we O

Another Property

given Agentive

also Property
of O

In O
a O

a O
district_manager Animate

been O
recently Property
appointed Agentive

his O
position Agentive
after O
being UnboundedEvent
outstandingly Property

as O
a O

manager Animate

found Mental
that O
in O
supervising Agentive

he O
was O
having Mental
a O
difficult Property
time BoundedEvent

On O
playing Agentive
some O
typical Property
situations UnboundedEvent
before O
a O
jury Object
of O
his O
peers Animate
he O
showed Mental
some O
characteristics Property
rated Mental

unsatisfactory Property

He O
was O
told Mental
he O
displayed Mental
, O
for_example Property
, O
a O
sense Mental
of O
superiority Property

and O
he O
answered Mental

`` O
Well O

I O

are O

? O
He O
was O
criticized Mental

his O
curtness Property

he O
answered Mental

`` O
I O

On O
being O
criticized Mental

`` O
I O

In_short Property

as O
frequently Property
happens BoundedEvent
in O

the O
individual Animate

However Property

in O
this O
case UnboundedEvent
the O
district_manager Animate
was O
led Mental
to O
see Mental
the O
errors Agentive

his O
ways Mental
. O
The O
necessary Property
step Agentive
between O
diagnosis Agentive
and O
training Agentive
is UnboundedEvent
acceptance Mental
of O
the O

of O
the O
criticisms Mental
. O
How O
this O
was O
accomplished Agentive
may O
be O
described Mental
, O
since O
this O
sometimes Property
is UnboundedEvent
a O
crucial Property
problem Mental
. O
The O
director Animate
helped Agentive
tailor-make Agentive
a O
check_list Mental
of O
the O
district_manager Animate

errors Agentive
by O
asking Mental
various Property
observers Animate
to O
write_out Agentive
sentences Mental
commenting Mental

the O
mistakes Agentive
they O
felt Mental

made Agentive

These O
errors Agentive
were O
then Property
collected Mental

written Agentive
on O
a O
blackboard Object

condensing BoundedEvent
similar Property
ideas Mental
. O
Eighteen Property
errors Agentive
were O
located Mental
, O
and O
then Property
the O
director Animate
asked Mental
each O
individual Animate
to O
vote Agentive
whether O
or O
not Property
they O
felt Mental
that O
this O
manager Animate
had O
made Agentive
the O
particular Property
errors Agentive
. O
They O
were O
asked Mental
to O
vote Agentive
`` O
true Property

if O
they O
thought Mental
they O
had O
seen Mental
him O
make Agentive
the O
error Agentive

`` O

if O
they O
thought Mental
he O
had O
not Property
; O
and O
`` O
cannot O
say Mental
'' O
if O
they O
were UnboundedEvent
not Property
certain Property
. O
The O
manager Animate
sat UnboundedEvent
behind O
the O
group Object
so Property
he O
could O
see Mental
and O
count Mental
the O
hands Object
that O
went_up BoundedEvent

and O
the O
director Animate

the O
numbers Property
on O
the O

No O

The O

The O
first Property
eight Property
of O
these O
eighteen Property

which O
received Mental
at_least Property
one-half Mental
of O
the O

were O
duplicated Agentive
to O
form UnboundedEvent
an O

checklist Mental
for O
the O
particular Property
manager Animate

and O
when O
this O
particular Property
manager Animate
roleplayed Agentive
in O
other Property
situations UnboundedEvent
, O
the O
members Animate
checked Mental
any O
items Mental
that O
appeared BoundedEvent

To O
prevent Agentive
the O
manager Animate
from O
deliberately Property
controlling Agentive
himself O
only Property
during O
the O
sessions Agentive
, O
they O
were UnboundedEvent
rather Property
lengthy Property
( O
about O
twenty Property
minutes Mental
) O
, O
the O
situations UnboundedEvent
were O
imperfectly Property
described Mental
to O
the O
manager Animate
so Property
that O
he O
would O
not Property
know Mental
what O
to O
expect Mental
, O
new Property
antagonists Animate
were O
brought BoundedEvent
on O
the O
scene Object
unexpectedly Property
, O
and O
the O
antagonists Animate
were O
instructed Mental
to O
deliberately Property
behave BoundedEvent
in O
such Property
ways Property
as O
to O
upset Mental
the O
manager Animate

get BoundedEvent
him O
to O
operate UnboundedEvent
in O
a O
manner Property
for O
which O
he O
had O
been O
previously Property

After O
every O
session Agentive

the O
check_marks Mental

totaled Mental
up O
and O
graphed Agentive
, O
and O
in O
this O
way Agentive
the O
supervisor Animate

progress Agentive
was O
charted Mental
. O
In O
life Mental
we O
learn Mental
to O
play Agentive
our O
roles Agentive
and O
we O
`` O
freeze BoundedEvent
'' O
into O
patterns Agentive
which O
become BoundedEvent
so Property
habitual Property
that O
we O
are UnboundedEvent
not Property
really Property
aware Property
of O
what O
we O
do Agentive

We O
can O

we O
can O

we O

To O

what O
we O
do Agentive

To O

the O
second Property
step Agentive

To O

the O
third Property
step Agentive

To O
practice Agentive
new Property
procedures Agentive
under O
guided Property
supervision Agentive
and O
with O
constant Property
feedback Mental
is UnboundedEvent
the O
fourth Property
step Agentive
. O
To O
use Agentive
these O
new Property
ways Agentive
in O
daily Property
life UnboundedEvent
is UnboundedEvent
the O
last Property
step Agentive
. O
Roleplaying Agentive
used Property
for O
analysis Agentive
follows Agentive
these O
general Property
steps Agentive
leading UnboundedEvent
to O
training Agentive
. O
When O
an O
evaluative Property
situation UnboundedEvent
is O
set_up Agentive
, O
and O
no O
concern Mental
is UnboundedEvent
with O
the O
details Mental
that O
lead UnboundedEvent
to O
an O
over-all Property
estimate Agentive
, O
we O
say Mental
that O
roleplaying Agentive
is O
used Agentive
for O
evaluation Agentive
. O
Observers Animate
can O
see Mental
a O
person Animate
engaged Mental
in O
spontaneous Property
behavior Agentive
, O
and O
watch Mental
him O
operating UnboundedEvent
in O
a O
totalistic Property
fashion Property
. O
This O
behavior Agentive
is UnboundedEvent
more Property
`` O
veridical Property
'' O
- O
or O
true Property
than O
other Property
testing Agentive
behavior Agentive
for O
some O
types Mental
of O
evaluation Agentive
, O
and O
so O
can O
give Mental
quick Property
and O
accurate Property
estimates Agentive
of O
complex Property
functioning Agentive
. O
While O
roleplaying Agentive
for O
testing Agentive
is O
not Property
too Property
well Property
understood Mental
at O
the O
present Property
time Mental
, O
it O
represents UnboundedEvent
one O
of O
the O
major Property
uses Agentive

this O
procedure Agentive

The O
objective Mental
of O
this O
chapter Mental
is UnboundedEvent
to O
clarify BoundedEvent
the O
distinctions Property
between O
spontaneity Property
theory Mental

other Property
training Agentive
concepts Mental
. O
In_addition Property
, O
the O
basic Property
approach Agentive
utilized Agentive
in O
applying Agentive
roleplaying Agentive
will O
be O
reviewed Mental
. O
The O
goal Mental
will O
be UnboundedEvent
to O
provide Mental
the O
reader Animate
with O
an O
integrated Property
rationale Mental
to O
aid Agentive
him O
in O
applying Agentive
roleplaying Agentive
techniques Mental
in O
this O
unique Property

area UnboundedEvent
. O
The O
reasons Mental
for O
extracting UnboundedEvent
this O
particular Property
roleplaying Agentive
application Agentive
from O
the O
previous Property
discussion Mental
of O
training Agentive
are UnboundedEvent
twofold Property
: O
Spontaneity Property
training Agentive
theory Mental
is UnboundedEvent
unique Property
and O
relatively Property
new Property
. O
It O
is O
not Property
easy Property
for O
the O
therapist Animate
to O
discern Mental
when O
, O
in O
the O
patient Animate

communicating Mental
, O
an O
introject Mental
has O
appeared BoundedEvent
and O
is O
holding_sway Agentive

One O
learns Mental
to O
become BoundedEvent
alert Property
to O
changes BoundedEvent
in O
his O
vocal Property
tone Mental
- O
to O
his O
voice Mental

suddenly Property
shifting BoundedEvent
to O
a O
quality Property
not Property
like O
his O
usual Property
one O
, O
a O
quality Property
which O
sounds Mental
somehow Property
artificial Property
or O
, O
in O
some Property
instances BoundedEvent
, O
parrotlike Property
. O
The O
content Mental
of O
his O
words Mental
may O
lapse BoundedEvent
back Property
into O
monotonous Property
repetition BoundedEvent
, O
as O
if O
a O
phonograph_needle Object
were O
stuck UnboundedEvent
in O
one Property
groove Property
; O
only Property
seldom Property
is UnboundedEvent
it O
so Property
simple Property
as O
to O
be UnboundedEvent
a O
matter Mental
of O
his O
obviously Property
parroting Mental
some Property
timeworn Property
axiom Mental
, O
common Property
to O
our O
culture Object
, O
which O
he O
has O
evidently Property
heard Mental
, O
over_and_over Property
, O
from O
a O
parent Animate
until O
he O
experiences Mental
it O
as O
part UnboundedEvent
of O
him O
. O
One Property
hebephrenic Property
woman Animate
often Property
became BoundedEvent
submerged UnboundedEvent
in O
what O
felt UnboundedEvent
to O
me O
like O
a O
somehow Property
phony Property
experience BoundedEvent
of O
pseudo Property
emotion Mental
, O
during O
which O
, O
despite O
her O
wracking O
sobs Mental
and O
streaming Property
cheeks Object
, O
I O
felt Mental
only Property
a O
cold Property
annoyance UnboundedEvent
with O
her O
. O
Eventually Property
such Property
incidents BoundedEvent
became BoundedEvent
more Property
sporadic Property
, O
and O
more Property
sharply Property
demarcated Mental
from O
her O
day-after-day Property
behavior Agentive
, O
and O
in O
one Property
particular Property
session Mental
, O
after O
several Property
minutes Mental
of O
such Property
behavior Agentive
- O
which O
, O
as_usual Property
, O
went_on BoundedEvent
without O
any O
accompanying Property
words Mental
from O
her O
- O
she O
asked Mental
, O
eagerly Property
, O
`` O
Did O
you O
see Mental
Granny Animate

? O
At_first Property
I O
did O
not Property
know Mental
what O
she O
meant Mental
; O
I O
thought Mental
she O
must O
be O
seeing Mental
me O
as O
some O
one O
who O
had O
just Property
come BoundedEvent
from O
seeing Agentive
her O
grandmother Animate
, O
in O
their O
distant Property
home Property

Then Property
I O
realized Mental
that O
she O
had O
been O
deliberately Property
showing Mental
me O
, O
this O
time BoundedEvent
, O
what O
Granny Animate
was UnboundedEvent
like O
; O
and O
when O
I O
replied Mental
in O
this O
spirit Mental
, O
she O
corroborated Mental
my O
hunch Mental
. O
At O
another Property
phase Mental
in O
the O
therapy Agentive
, O
when O
a O
pathogenic Property
mother Animate
introject Mental
began BoundedEvent
to O
emerge BoundedEvent
more_and_more Property
upon O
the O
investigative Property
scene UnboundedEvent
, O
she O
muttered Mental
in O
a O
low Property
but O
intense Property
voice Property
, O
to O
herself O
, O
`` O
I O
hate Mental
that O
woman Animate
inside O
me O
'' O
! O
I O
could O
evoke Mental
no O
further Property
elaboration Agentive
from O
her O
about O
this O
; O
but O
a_few Property
seconds Mental
later Property
she O
was O
standing UnboundedEvent
directly Property
across O
the O
room Object
from O
me O
, O
looking Mental
me O
in O
the O
eyes Object
and O
saying Mental
in O
a O
scathingly Property
condemnatory Property
tone Mental
, O
`` O
Your O
father Animate
despises Mental
you O
'' O
! O
Again Property
, O
I O
at_first Property
misconstrued Mental
this O
disconcertingly Property
intense Property
communication Mental
, O
and O
I O
quickly Property
cast Mental
through O
my O
mind Mental
to O
account_for Mental
her O
being UnboundedEvent
able Property
to O
speak Mental
, O
with O
such Property
utter Property
conviction Mental
, O
of O
an O
opinion Mental
held Mental
by O
my O
father Animate

now Property
several Property
years Mental
deceased Property

Then Property
I O
replied Mental
, O
coldly Property
, O
`` O
If O
you O
despise Mental
me O
, O
why O
do O

you O

so Property

directly Property

? O
She O
looked BoundedEvent
confused Property
at O
this O

and O
I O
felt Mental
sure Property
it O
had O
been UnboundedEvent
a O
wrong Property
response Mental
for O
me O
to O
make Agentive
. O
It O
then Property
occurred Mental
to O
me O
to O
ask Mental
, O
`` O
Is O
that O
what O
that O
woman Animate
told Mental
you O
'' O
? O
She O
clearly Property
agreed Mental
that O
this O
had O
been UnboundedEvent
the O
case Mental

I O
realized Mental

now Property
, O
that O
she O
had O
been O
showing Mental
me O
, O
in O
what O
impressed Mental
me O
as O
being UnboundedEvent
a O
very Property
accurate Property
way Property
, O
something O
her O
mother Animate
had O
once Property
said Mental
to O
her O
; O
it O
was UnboundedEvent
as O
if O
she O
was O
showing Mental
me O
one Property
of O
the O
reasons Mental
why O
she O
hated Mental
that O

her O
. O
What O
had O
been UnboundedEvent
an O
unmanageably Property
powerful Property
introject Mental
was UnboundedEvent
now Property
, O
despite O
its O
continuing Property
charge Agentive

energy Physical
disconcerting Property
to O
me O
, O
sufficiently Property
within O

of O
her O

that O

use Agentive

what O
this O

Earlier Property

bad Property

cold Property
it O

all_but Property
undrinkable Property

especially Property
that O

She O
was UnboundedEvent
deeply Property

horribly Property
sure Property
that O
Lucien Animate

filled BoundedEvent

She O
had O

she O

if O

not_only Property
the O

She O
felt BoundedEvent

at_the_same_time Property

Now Property
wait UnboundedEvent
a O
minute Mental

she O
told Mental

, O
think_about Mental
it O
; O
Lucien Animate

not Property
the O
only Property
person Animate
in O
this O
house Object
who O
could O
have O
put UnboundedEvent
opium Object
in O
that O
coffee Object
. O
She O
had O
lost Mental
a O
bottle Object
of O
opium Object
- O
but O
that O
was UnboundedEvent
on O
the O
trip Agentive
from O
New_Orleans Object
. O
Or O
someone O
had O
taken Mental
it O
during O
her O
first Property
day Mental
at O
Honotassa Object
. O
Yes O
, O
she O
had O
missed Mental
it O
after O
her O
talk Mental
with O
Emile Animate
, O
after O
dinner Object
, O
just Property
before O
Emile Animate
was O
shot Agentive
. O
Rilly Animate
or O
Glendora Animate
had O
entered BoundedEvent
her O
room Object
while O
she O
slept BoundedEvent
, O
bringing BoundedEvent
back Property
her O
washed Property
clothes Object
. O
So O
somebody O

could O
have O
come_in BoundedEvent
, O
too Property
- O
then Property
or O
later Property
while O
she O
was UnboundedEvent
out O
of O
the O

It O
would O
have O
been UnboundedEvent
easy Property
to O
identify Mental

opium Object

its O

. O
It O
was UnboundedEvent
not Property
very Property
reasonable Property
to O
believe Mental
that O
Lucien Animate

unprocurable Property
opium Object

come_back BoundedEvent

Honotassa Object
with O
a O

plan Mental

murder Agentive

. O
He O
did O
n't Property
even Property

that O
she O

there Property
. O
And O
he O
certainly Property
could O

have O
guessed Mental
that O
she O
would O
resist Agentive
his O
demand Mental
for O
the O
gold Dynamic+Possession
or O
that O
she O
was UnboundedEvent
not Property
the O
yielding Property
- O
yes O
, O
and O
credible Property
fool Animate
he O
had Mental
every O
right Property
to O
expect Mental
. O
No O
, O
he O
had O
been O
surprised Mental
, O
unpleasantly Property
surprised Mental
, O
but O
surprised Mental
. O
Then Property
somebody O
else Property
? O
Do O
n't Property
question Mental
, O
Rev Animate
had O
said Mental
, O
do O
n't Property
invite Mental
danger UnboundedEvent
. O
Her O
skin Object
crawled UnboundedEvent
: O
Lolotte Animate
had O
told Mental
Maude Animate
that O
she O
was UnboundedEvent
in O
the O
hall Object
and O
the O
door Object
was UnboundedEvent
open Property
. O
Sarah Animate
had O
begun BoundedEvent
to O
tell Mental
Lucien Animate
of O
Emile Animate
, O
she O
had O
begun BoundedEvent
to O
question Mental
and O
a O
little Property
draft Physical
had O
crept BoundedEvent
across O
the O
room Object
from O
the O
bedroom Object
door Object
, O
open Property
barely Property
enough Property
to O
show Mental
a O
rim Property
of O
blackness UnboundedEvent
in O
the O
hall Object
. O
So O
Lolotte Animate
- O
or O
anybody O
- O
could O
have O
listened Mental
, O
and O
that O
somebody O
could O
have O
already Property
been UnboundedEvent
supplied_with Property
the O
missing Property
bottle Object
of O
opium Object
. O
That O
was UnboundedEvent
not Property
reasonable Property
either O
. O
The O
opium Object
had O
disappeared BoundedEvent
before O
Emile Animate
's O
death BoundedEvent
and O
whoever O
shot Agentive
him O
could O
not Property
by O
any O
stretch Agentive
of O
the O
imagination Mental
have O
foreseen Mental
Sarah Animate
's O
own Property
doubts Mental
and O
suspicions Mental
- O
and O
questions Mental
. O
She O
began BoundedEvent
to O
doubt Mental
whether O
there O
had O
been UnboundedEvent
in_fact Property
a O
lethal_dose Object
of O
opium Object
in O
the O
cup Object
. O
So O
suppose Mental
somebody O
only Property
wished Mental
to O
frighten Mental
her O
, O
so Property
she O
would O
leave BoundedEvent
Honotassa Object
! O
That O
made Agentive
a O
certain Property
amount Property
of O
logic Mental
. O
Added Property
to O
the O
argument Mental
was UnboundedEvent
the O
fact Mental
that O
while O
she O
might O
have O
tasted Agentive
the O
coffee Object
if O
it O
had O
been UnboundedEvent
still Property
hot Property
, O
she O
might O
even Property
have O
drunk Agentive
some O
of O
it O
, O
she O
would O
n't Property
have O
taken Agentive
enough Property
to O
kill UnboundedEvent
her O
, O
for O
she O
would O
have O
been O
warned Mental
by O
its O
taste Mental
. O
No O
. O
It O
was UnboundedEvent
merely Property
an O
attempt Agentive
to O
frighten Mental
her O
. O
She O
would O
n't Property
go_back BoundedEvent
to O
New_York Object
as O
Maude Animate
suggested Mental
; O
she O
would O
n't Property
run BoundedEvent
like O
a O
scared Property
cat Animate
. O
But O
- O
well O
, O
she O
'd O
be UnboundedEvent
very Property
careful Property
. O
She O
dressed BoundedEvent
and O
the O
accustomed Property
routine Agentive
restored Mental
to O
her O
a O
sense Mental
of O
normal Property
everyday Property
life UnboundedEvent
. O
But O
before O
she O
left BoundedEvent
her O
room Object
she O
dug_into UnboundedEvent
her O
big Property
moire Object
bag Object
, O
took_out UnboundedEvent
the O
envelope Object
holding UnboundedEvent
her O
marriage_contract Mental
and O
the O
wax Object
seal Object
had O
been O
broken BoundedEvent
. O
So O
somebody O
else Property
knew Mental
what O
would O
happen BoundedEvent
to O
her O
father Animate
's O
money Dynamic+Possession
if O
she O
died BoundedEvent
. O
Rev Animate
had O
known Mental
all_along Property
. O
Rev Animate
did O
n't Property
need UnboundedEvent
to O
break BoundedEvent
the O
wax Object
seal Object
, O
read Mental
the O
contract Mental
and O
find_out Mental
. O
He O
could O
conceivably Property
have O
wished Mental
to O
make Agentive
sure Property
; O
Rev Animate
loved Mental
Honotassa Object
, O
it O
was UnboundedEvent
like O
a O
part Object
of O
his O
breath Object
and O
body Object
; O
Rev Animate
had O
stressed Mental
the O
need UnboundedEvent
for O
money Dynamic+Possession
. O
Rev Animate
would O
never Property
have O
tried Agentive
to O
give Mental
her O
poison Object
! O
She O
thrust BoundedEvent
the O
envelope Object
back Property
in O
the O

; O
there O
was UnboundedEvent
no Property
point Mental
in O
locking UnboundedEvent
it O
up O
in O
the O
armoire Object
now Property
, O
it O
was UnboundedEvent
like O
locking UnboundedEvent
the O
barn Object
after O
the O
horse Animate
was O
stolen Mental
. O
And O
in_all_likelihood Property
, O
by O
now Property
, O
there O
was UnboundedEvent
more Property

one Property
person Animate

the O

knew Mental

There O
was UnboundedEvent
no Property

in O

what O
a O

she O

She O
went BoundedEvent

for O
when O
Glendora Animate

Sarah Animate

Why O

Men Animate

she O

even Property

after_all Property

Stanley Animate
really Property

quite Property

That O

He O

The O

He O

upstairs Property
to O

good_night Mental

She O
had O
invited UnboundedEvent
him O
in Property
for O
coffee Object

It O
was UnboundedEvent
in O
the O
kitchen Object

as O
she O
was O
watching Agentive
the O

waiting UnboundedEvent
for O
the O

that O
he O

Without O

without O
giving Mental
her O
a O
chance UnboundedEvent

it O

From O

he O
had O
put UnboundedEvent

on O
her O

, O
turned BoundedEvent
her O
around O
, O
and O
pressed UnboundedEvent
her O

him O

so Property
close Property
she O

Later Property
, O
she O
apologized Mental
for O
the O
long Property

his O

, O
tried Agentive

explain Mental
she O

that O
the O
panic Mental
arose UnboundedEvent
in O
her O
unwanted Property

But O
he O
had O

When O
he O
left BoundedEvent

she O

she O

never Property

Stanley Animate

She O

what O
Stanley Animate

going_to O

ever O
since O
she O
first Property
met Agentive
him O

Except O
for O
that O
one Property
morning Mental

The O
morning Mental
he O
walked BoundedEvent
in Property
to O
announce Mental
to O
her O
, O
blushing Property
, O
that O
he O
was UnboundedEvent
married Property
. O
She O
thought Mental
she O
was O
going_to O

She O
had O
assumed Mental
before O
then O
that O
one Property

he O
would O
ask Mental
her O
to O

him O
. O
Blanche Animate
could O
n't Property
remember Mental
when O
she O
had O
first Property
arrived BoundedEvent
at O
this O
conclusion Mental
. O
She O
thought Mental
it O
was O
sometime Property
during O
the O
second Property
week Mental
she O
worked Agentive
for O
Stanley Animate
. O
It O
was O
nothing Mental
that O
he O
said Mental
or O
did Agentive
, O
but O
it O
seemed Mental
so Property
natural Property
to O
her O
that O
she O
should O
be O
working Agentive
for O
him O
, O
looking_forward Mental
to O
his O
eventual Property
proposal Mental
. O
She O
was UnboundedEvent
thirty-one O
years Mental
old Property
then Property
. O
Her O
mother Animate
was UnboundedEvent
already Property
considerably Property
concerned Property
over O
her O
daughter Animate

future Mental
. O
But O
Blanche Animate
had O
been O
able Property
to O
maintain Agentive
a O
serene Property
and O
assured Property
composure Property
in O
the O
face Agentive
of O
her O
widowed Property
mother Animate

continued Property
carping Mental
, O
had O
been UnboundedEvent
able Property
to O
resist UnboundedEvent
her O
urgings Mental
to O
date Agentive
anyone O
who O
offered Mental
the O
slightest Property
possibility Mental
of O
matrimony UnboundedEvent

For O
Blanche Animate
, O
it O
was O
only Property
a O
matter Mental
of O
time Mental
before O
Stanley Animate
would O
propose Mental
. O
It O
was O
to_be_expected O
that O
Stanley Animate
would O
be UnboundedEvent
shy Property
, O
slow Property
in O
taking Agentive
such Property
a O
momentous Property
step Agentive
. O
Stanley Animate
went_along UnboundedEvent
in O
life Mental
, O
she O
knew Mental
, O
convinced Property
that O
he O
deserved UnboundedEvent
the O
love Mental
and O
faith Mental
of O
no O
woman Animate
. O
As_a_result O
, O
he O
never Property
looked_for UnboundedEvent
it O
. O
But O
one Property
day Mental
, O
she O
expected Mental
, O
he O
would O
somehow Property
discover Mental
, O
without O
her O
having_to O
tell Mental
him O
, O
that O
there O
was O
such Property
a O

the O

a O

who O
was UnboundedEvent
willing Property

and O
anything O
else Property
a O

could O
give Mental
a O

Indeed Property

there O
was O
a O

who O
, O
unasked Property

had O
already Property
given Mental
him O
love Mental

Unquestionably Property
, O
Blanche Animate
loved Mental
Stanley Animate

And_then Property
, O
unexpectedly Property
, O
Stanley Animate
made O
his O
announcement Mental
. O
On O
that O
first Property
day Mental
, O
Blanche Animate
literally Property
thought Mental
she O
was O
going_to O
die BoundedEvent

or O
, O
at Property
the O
very Property
least O
, O
go O
out O
of O
her O
mind Mental
. O
It O
might O
have O
been UnboundedEvent
easier Property
for O
her O
if O
Kitti_Walker Animate

n't Property
been UnboundedEvent
everything O
that O
Blanche Animate

not Property

Kitti Animate
was UnboundedEvent
thirty Property

younger Property

taller Property

Stanley Animate

prettier Property
than O
Stanley Animate
had Mental
any O
right Property
to O
hope Mental

, O
much_less O

. O
Kitti Animate
could O
have O
married Agentive
a O
score Object
of O

There O
was O
no O
reason Mental
for O
her O
to O
marry Agentive
someone O
like O
Stanley_Gilborn Animate
, O
there O
was O
no O
need UnboundedEvent
for O
her O
to O
marry Agentive
Stanley Animate

Kitti Animate
had O
come BoundedEvent
into O
the O
office Object
, O
on O
somebody O
's O
recommendation Mental
, O
because O
she O
needed Agentive
help Agentive
in O
preparing Agentive
her O
income_tax_return Mental
. O
Stanley Animate
had O
filled_out Mental
the O
return Mental
and O
because O
, O
when O
he O
was UnboundedEvent
finished Property
, O
it O
was O
close Property
to O
the O
lunch Object
hour Mental
, O
he O
had O
politely Property
asked Mental
Kitti Animate
to O
join Agentive
him O
, O
never Property
expecting Mental
her O
to O
accept Mental
. O
Blanche Animate
knew Mental
all O
this O
because O
the O
door Object
to O
Stanley Animate

office Object
was UnboundedEvent
open Property
and O
, O
without O
straining Agentive
too Property
hard Property
, O
she O
could O
hear Mental
everything O
that O

said Mental
. O
Stanley Animate
had O
gone_out BoundedEvent

saying Mental
he O
would O
be UnboundedEvent
back Property
in O
an O
hour Mental
. O
He O
had O
n't Property
come_back BoundedEvent
for O
over O

After O
that O
day Mental
, O
Blanche Animate
still Property
did O
n't Property
know Mental
exactly Property
what O
had O
happened BoundedEvent

There O
were O
mornings Mental
when O
Stanley Animate
came_in BoundedEvent

afternoons Mental
when O
he O
left BoundedEvent
early Property

days Mental
when O
he O
did O

come_in BoundedEvent

Blanche Animate
knew Mental
something O
must O
be O
causing Agentive
Stanley Animate

new Property

strange Property
behavior Agentive
but O
she O
never Property
once Property
connected Mental
it O
with O
Kitti_Walker Animate

It O
was UnboundedEvent

Then Property
, O
six Property

the O

Kitti Animate

the O

Stanley Animate

Somehow Property

That O
night Mental
the O

While O

running Agentive

On O

She O

`` O
I O
asked Mental
her O
why O
she O

it O

tonight Mental

she O

afraid Property

'' O
. O
Casey Animate
made Agentive
some O
comment Mental
, O
but O
his O
mind Mental
was UnboundedEvent
busy Property
as O
he O
considered Mental
the O
man Animate
. O
His O
name Mental
was UnboundedEvent
George_Needham Animate
and O
he O
, O
too Property
, O
had O
come BoundedEvent
from O
a O
good Property
family Object
. O
He O
was UnboundedEvent
perhaps Property
thirty-two O
, O
nicely Property
set_up Property
, O
with O
light_brown Property
hair Object
that O
had UnboundedEvent
a O
pronounced Property
wave Object
. O
He O
was UnboundedEvent
always Property
well Property
groomed Property

well Property
tailored Property
, O
and O
he O
had Mental
that O
rich_man Animate

look Property
which O
was UnboundedEvent
authentic Property
enough Property
and O
came BoundedEvent
from O
two Property
good Property
prep_schools Object
and O
a O
proper Property
university Object
. O
An O
only Property
child Animate
, O
he O
had O
done Agentive
all O
the O
things Agentive
that O
young_men Animate
do O
who O
have O
been O
born BoundedEvent
to O
money Dynamic+Possession
and O
social Property
position UnboundedEvent
until O
his O
father Animate
double-crossed Agentive
him O
by O
dying BoundedEvent
broke Property
. O
Since O
then O
he O
had O
worked_at Agentive
this O
and O
that O
, O
though O
some O
said Mental
his O
main Property
interest Agentive
was UnboundedEvent
gambling Agentive

All O
this O
went Agentive
through O
Casey Animate

mind Mental
in O
the O
first Property
instant Mental
, O
but O
what O
held UnboundedEvent
his O
interest Mental
was O
the O
fact Mental
that O
these O
two Property
should O
be UnboundedEvent
together Property
at_all Property
. O
For O
he O
had O
understood Mental
that O
Betty Animate

been O
engaged Mental
to O
a O
boy Animate

Barry_Jenkins Animate

She O
had O
grown_up Agentive
with O
young Property
Jenkins Animate

he O
had O
heard Mental
that O
they O
had O
been O
at O
the O
point UnboundedEvent

getting_married Agentive
at_least Property
twice Property

He O
wanted Mental
to O
ask Mental
her O
about O
Jenkins Animate
now Property
, O
but O
he O
knew Mental
he O
could O
n't Property
do O
so O
in O
Needham Animate

presence Object

And O
so O
, O
still Property
wondering Mental
and O
a_little Property
perplexed Property
, O
he O
grinned BoundedEvent
at O
the O
girl Animate
and O
spoke Mental
lightly Property
to O
make_sure Agentive
that O
she O
would O
know Mental
he O
was O
kidding Mental

`` O
Where O

Casey Animate
kept UnboundedEvent
his O
smile Mental

but O
some O
small Property
inner Property
disturbance BoundedEvent
was O
working_on Agentive
him O
as O
he O
thought Mental
again Property
about O
Needham Animate
, O
who O
was UnboundedEvent
eight Property
or O
ten Property
years Mental
older Property
than O
the O

He O
wondered Mental
whether O
Needham Animate
was O
going_to O
swear_off Mental
gambling Agentive
and O
get Mental
a O
steady Property
job Agentive
or O
whether O
he O
was O
counting_on Mental
the O
income Dynamic+Possession

Betty Animate

subsidize Mental
him O

None O
of_this O
showed Mental
in O
his O
face Object

and O
he O
tried Agentive

keep Agentive
his O
skepticism Mental
in_hand Property

He O
made Agentive
a O
point Mental
of O
frowning BoundedEvent

of O
acting_out Agentive
the O
part Mental

the O
fond Property
father Animate
confessor Animate

`` O
I O

`` O

`` O

`` O

Needham Animate

and O
though O
he O
spoke Mental
with O
a O
smile Mental
, O
Casey Animate
somehow Property
got Mental
the O
idea Mental
that O
he O
was UnboundedEvent

amused Property

`` O
Stop_by O

Casey Animate
watched Agentive

still Property
frowning BoundedEvent
absently Property
and_then Property
dismissing Mental
the O
matter Mental
as O
he O
called_for Mental

As O
he O
went_out BoundedEvent
he O
told Mental
Freddie Animate
the O
dinner Object

perfect Property

and O
when O
he O
got Mental
his O
hat Object

coat Object
from O
Nancy_Parks Animate

put UnboundedEvent
a O
fifty-piece_piece Dynamic+Possession

the O

, O
he O
told Mental
her O
to O

it O

A O
taxi Object
took BoundedEvent
him O

the O

he O

left Mental
his O

and O
a_few Property
minutes Mental
later Property
he O
found Mental
a O
parking_place Object
across O
the O
street Object

his O

Because O
his O
mind Mental

been O
otherwise Property
occupied Mental

the O
past Property

hours Mental

he O
did O
not Property

Jerry_Burton Animate

there O

In_fact Property
, O
he O
did O
not Property
think_about Mental
Jerry_Burton Animate
at_all Property
until O
he O
entered BoundedEvent
his O
living_room Object

closed UnboundedEvent
the O
door Object
behind O
him O
. O
Only Property
then Property
, O
when O
his O
glance Agentive
focused_on UnboundedEvent
the O
divan Object
and O
saw Mental
that O
it O
was UnboundedEvent
empty Property
, O
did O
he O
remember Mental
his O
earlier Property
problem UnboundedEvent

Even Property
from O
where O
he O
stood UnboundedEvent
he O
could O
see Mental
the O
neatly Property
folded Property
blanket Object
that O
he O
had O
spread_over UnboundedEvent
Burton Animate

the O
pillow Object

the O
sheet_of_paper Mental

Then Property
he O
was O
striding BoundedEvent

his O
thoughts Mental
confused Property

the O
worry Mental
building BoundedEvent
swiftly Property
inside Property
him O
as O
he O
snatched_up UnboundedEvent
the O
note Mental

Jack Animate
: O
Look Mental
in O
the O
wastebasket Object

I O
knew Mental
the O
only Property
way Property
I O

it O

a O
good Property
try Agentive

kid O
, O
and O
I O
appreciate Mental
it O

J. O
. O
The O
wastebasket Object
stood UnboundedEvent
near O
the O
wall Object
next Property
to O
the O
divan Object
, O
and O
the O
instant Mental
Casey Animate
picked UnboundedEvent
it O
up O
he O
knew Mental
what O
had O
happened BoundedEvent
. O
The O
discarded Property
papers Mental
inside O
were UnboundedEvent
sodden Property
, O
there O
was UnboundedEvent
a O
glint BoundedEvent
of O
liquid Property
at O
the O
bottom Object
, O
and O
the O
smell Mental
of O
whisky Object
was UnboundedEvent
strong Property
and O
distinct Property
. O
He O
put UnboundedEvent
the O
basket Object
down Property
distastefully Property
, O
muttering Mental
softly Property
and O
thoroughly Property
disgusted Property
with O
himself O
and O
his O
plan Mental
that O
had O
seemed Mental
so Property
foolproof Property
. O
For O
he O
remembered Mental
too O
well Property
how O
he O
had O
brought BoundedEvent
back Property
the O
loaded Property
drinks Object
to O
Burton Animate
and_then Property
returned BoundedEvent
to O
the O
kitchen Object
to O
get Mental
weaker Property
drinks Object
for O
himself O
. O
For O
another O
second Mental
or O
two Property
he O
gave_in Mental
to O
the O
annoyance Mental
that O
was O
directed Agentive
at O
himself O
; O
then Property
his O
mind Mental
moved_on BoundedEvent
to O
be O
confronted Mental
by O
something O
far Property
more Property
serious Property
, O
and O
as O
the O
thought Mental
expanded BoundedEvent
, O
the O
implications Mental
jarred UnboundedEvent
him O
. O
It O
no_longer Property
mattered UnboundedEvent
that O
Burton Animate
had O
outsmarted Agentive
him O
. O
The O
important Property
thing UnboundedEvent
was UnboundedEvent
that O
Burton Animate
had O
gone BoundedEvent
somewhere Property
to O
meet Agentive
a O
blackmailer Animate
with O
a O
gun Object
in O
his O
pocket Object
. O
And O
that O
gun Object
was UnboundedEvent
empty Property
. O
Even Property
before O
his O
mind Mental
had O
rounded_out BoundedEvent
the O
idea Mental
, O
he O
thrust BoundedEvent
one Property
hand Object
into O
his O
trousers Object
pocket Object
and O
pulled_out BoundedEvent
the O
six Property
slugs Object
he O
had O
taken BoundedEvent
from O
the O
revolver Object
. O
He O
considered Mental
them O
with O
brooding Property
eyes Object
, O
brows Object
bunched UnboundedEvent
as O
his O
brain Mental
grappled Agentive
with O
the O
problem UnboundedEvent
and O
tried Agentive
to O
find Mental
some O
solution Mental
. O
He O
said Mental
: O
`` O
The O
crazy Property
fool Animate
'' O
, O
half Property
aloud Property
. O
He O
put UnboundedEvent
the O
shells Object
on O
the O
table Object
, O
as O
though O
he O
could O
no_longer Property
bear Mental
to O
hold UnboundedEvent
them O
. O
He O
thought Mental
: O
Where O
the O
hell O
could O
he O
have O
gone BoundedEvent
? O
How O
can O
I O
find Mental
him O
? O
There O
was UnboundedEvent
no O
answer Mental
to O
this O
and O
he O
began BoundedEvent
to O
pace BoundedEvent
back_and_forth Property
across O
the O
room Object
, O
his O
imagination Mental
out O
of O
control Property
. O
He O
tried Agentive
to O
tell Mental
himself O
that O
maybe Property
Burton Animate
had O
sobered_up BoundedEvent
enough Property
to O
get Mental
some O
sense Mental
. O
Maybe Property
he O
only Property
intended Mental
to O
scare Mental
the O
blackmailer Animate
, O
whoever O
he O
was UnboundedEvent
, O
in_which_case O
an O
unloaded Property
gun Object
would O
be UnboundedEvent
good_enough Property
. O
He O
thought_of Mental
other Property
possibilities Mental
, O
none O
of O
them O
satisfactory Property
, O
and O
finally Property
he O
began BoundedEvent
to O
think Mental
, O
to O
wonder Mental
if O
there O
was UnboundedEvent
some O
way Property
he O
could O
reach Mental
Burton Animate
. O
Then Property
, O
as O
he O
turned BoundedEvent
toward O
the O
telephone Object
, O
it O
rang Mental
shrilly Property
to O
shatter BoundedEvent
the O
stillness Property
in O
the O
room Object
and O
he O
reached UnboundedEvent
for O
it O
eagerly Property
. O
`` O
Yeah O

, O
he O
said Mental

`` O
Casey Animate

? O
`` O
Yeah O

`` O
Tony_Calenda Animate

. O
Casey Animate
heard Mental
the O
voice Property
distinctly Property
and O
he O
knew Mental
who O
it O
was UnboundedEvent

but O
it O
took Mental
him O
a O
while Mental
to O
make Agentive
the O
mental Property
readjustment Agentive
and O
control Agentive
the O
disturbance UnboundedEvent
inside O
his O
head Mental

When O
he O
heard Mental
Calenda Animate
say Mental
: O
`` O
What O
about O

it O
still Property

had O
done Agentive
for O
Frank_Ackerly Animate

`` O

`` O

a_little Property

when O

him O
what O

taken Mental

Even_so Property

he O
generally Property

usually Property
reasonable Property

those O
who O
voiced Mental
their O
objections Mental
properly Property

Right Property
now Property

however Property
, O
he O
was O

worried Mental
about O
Jerry_Burton Animate

the O

that O

no O

the O

Burton Animate

too_much Property

Tony_Calenda Animate

His O
nerves Property
were O
getting BoundedEvent
a_little Property

his O

put UnboundedEvent
an O

in O
his O

`` O

`` O

He O
hung_up UnboundedEvent
with O
a O
bang BoundedEvent

annoyed Property
at O
himself O
for O
running_off_at_the_mouth O
like O
that O
but O
still Property
terribly Property
concerned UnboundedEvent
with O
the O
situation UnboundedEvent
he O
had O
helped Agentive

create Agentive

As_soon_as O
he O
could O
think Mental
logically Property
again Property
he O
reached UnboundedEvent
for O
the O
telephone_directory Mental
and O
found Mental
Jerry_Burton Animate

home Property
number Mental
. O
He O
dialed Mental
it O
and O
listened Mental
to O
it O
ring Mental
ten Property
times BoundedEvent
before O
he O
hung_up UnboundedEvent
. O
He O
called Mental
the O
bar Object

grill Object
where O
he O
had O
picked Mental
Burton Animate
up O
that O
afternoon Mental
. O
When O
he O
was O
told Mental
that O
no O
one Mental
had O
seen Mental
Burton Animate
since O
then Mental
, O
he O
thought_of Mental
three Property
other Property
places Object
that O

possibilities UnboundedEvent

Each O
time BoundedEvent
he O
got Mental
the O
same Property

in_the_end Property
he O
gave_up UnboundedEvent

By O
the O
time BoundedEvent
he O
had O
smoked Agentive
three Property

he O
had O
calmed_down Mental

He O
had O
done Agentive
all O
he O
could O

that O

that O

And O
anyway Property
Burton Animate

the O
kind Mental
of O

would O
be O
likely Property

get BoundedEvent
in_trouble Property
even Property
when O
he O

He O
, O
Casey Animate

had O
been O
scared Mental
for_a_while Property

but O
that O
had O
come UnboundedEvent
mostly Property
from O
the O
fact Mental
that O
he O
felt Mental

He O
should O
have O
stayed BoundedEvent

watched Agentive
Burton Animate

He O
did O

So O
he O
made Agentive
a O
mistake Agentive

So O
what O
? O
He O
kept UnboundedEvent
telling Mental
himself O
this O
as O
he O
went_out BoundedEvent
to O
the O

to O
make Agentive
a O

Only Property
then Property
did O
he O
decide Mental
he O
did O

He O
considered Mental
opening UnboundedEvent
a O
can Object
of O

vetoed Agentive

Finally Property
he O
went_into BoundedEvent

He O

a O
legitimate Property

It O

the O

The O

From O

Curt Animate

He O

hear Mental

Again Property

He O
found Mental

Curt Animate

even Property

He O
studied Mental
the O

a_few Property

thought_of Agentive

Reaching UnboundedEvent
across O
the O

he O

Curt Animate

Presently Property
he O
heard Mental
footsteps BoundedEvent

Jess Animate

The O

The O
horse Animate

Curt Animate

find Mental

Jess Animate
cursed Mental

entered BoundedEvent

A O

however Property

at_last Property

his O

the O
answer Mental
less Property
metaphysical Property

Did O

Did O
it O

he O
had O
only Property
done Agentive

This O
habit Agentive

become BoundedEvent

fixed Property
over O

years Mental
that O
it O
seemed Mental
futile Property

do Agentive
anything O

no_one O

He O
looked Mental
at O
the O

It O
was O
five Property

On O
some O

a O

far Property
down Property

an O

He O
turned_over BoundedEvent

pulled UnboundedEvent

At_least Property
he O

buy Mental

Thus Property

follow UnboundedEvent

He O
went BoundedEvent
down Property

Mills_and_Bradley Object

He O

if O

When O

the O

get BoundedEvent

down O

the O

He O
had O
made Agentive
such Property
a O
fuss UnboundedEvent
about O
buying Mental

that O
he O
knew Mental

He O
piled UnboundedEvent

a O
corner Object

the O

turned BoundedEvent

stare Mental
at O
the O

That O

The O

he O

pacify Mental

How O
in O
the O
world Object
did O
one O
attach UnboundedEvent

How O
did O
one O
attach UnboundedEvent
anything O

for_that_matter Property
? O
After O
the O
pegboard Object
there O

the O

He O
sat_down BoundedEvent
on O
an O
old Property

focused_on UnboundedEvent
the O
problem Mental

Perhaps Property
one O
bored UnboundedEvent
holes Object
in O
the O
stone Object
with O
some O
kind Mental
of O
an O
electric Property

But O
then Property
, O
when O
you O
stuck UnboundedEvent
things Object

the O
holes Object
, O
why O
did O

they O
come BoundedEvent
right Property
out O

? O
It O
all O
seemed Mental
rather Property
hopeless Property
. O
He O
turned BoundedEvent
his O
attention Mental
to O
the O
workbench Object
. O
Perhaps Property
that O
was UnboundedEvent
the O
first Property
thing Agentive
to O
do Agentive
. O
A O
workbench Object
had Mental
a O
heavy Property
top Object
and O
sturdy Property
legs Object

but O
how O
did O
you O
attach UnboundedEvent
sturdy Property
legs Object
to O
a O
heavy Property
top Object
so Property
that O
the O
whole_thing Object
did O
n't Property
wobble BoundedEvent
like O
a O
newborn Property
calf Animate

ultimately Property
collapse BoundedEvent
when O
you O
leaned_on UnboundedEvent
it O
? O
Mr._Mills Animate
had O
done Agentive
some O
figuring Mental

a O
scrap Object

given Mental
him O
the O
various Property

properly Property

he O

him O

turn_into UnboundedEvent

They O
lay UnboundedEvent
on O
the O

floor Object
in O
a O
disorderly Property

Mr._Crombie Animate
poked_at UnboundedEvent
it O
gingerly Property
with O
his O
foot Object

How O
could O
anyone O
know Mental
what O
to O
do Agentive

an O

Perhaps Property
he O
had_better O
have Mental
someone O

him O
put_up UnboundedEvent
the O
pegboard Object

build Agentive
the O
workbench Object
- O
someone O
who O
knew Mental
what O
he O

about O

Then Property
at_least Property
he O
would O
have Mental
a O
place Object
to O
hang UnboundedEvent
his O
tools Object

something O
to O
work Agentive

. O
After O
that O
everything O
should O
be UnboundedEvent
simpler Property
. O
He O
went BoundedEvent
upstairs Property
to O
phone Mental
Crumb Animate
. O
To O
his O
amazement Mental
he O
reached Mental
him O
. O
Mr._Crumb Animate
was UnboundedEvent
laid_up Property
with O
a O
bad Property
cold UnboundedEvent
. O
He O
did O
n't Property
seem Mental
to O
think Mental
that O
attaching UnboundedEvent
a O
pegboard Object

a O
stone Object
wall Object
was UnboundedEvent
much Property
of O
a O
problem UnboundedEvent
and O
he O
tossed_off O
the O
building Agentive

the O
worktable Object
equally Property
lightly Property
. O
The O
only Property
trouble Mental
was UnboundedEvent
that O
he O
himself O
was UnboundedEvent
tied_up Property
on O
the O
school Object
job Agentive
. O
That O
was UnboundedEvent
why O
he O
had O
n't Property
been UnboundedEvent
able Property
to O
finish BoundedEvent
the O
porch Object
. O
No O
, O
he O
did O
n't Property
know Mental

any O
handyman Animate
carpenter Animate

There O
was O
n't Property
any O
such Property

any_more Property
. O
Carpenters Animate
all O
wanted Agentive
steady Property
work Agentive
and O
at O
the O
moment Mental
every O
mother's_son O
for O
twenty Property
miles Mental
around O
that O
could O
hammer UnboundedEvent
nails Object
for O
twenty-five Property
dollars Dynamic+Possession
a O
day Mental
was O
working_on Agentive
the O
school Object
job Agentive

There O
was O
a O
fellow Animate
named Property
Blatz Animate
over O
Smithtown Object
way Object
. O
Nobody O
liked Mental

hire Agentive
him O
because O
you O
never Property
could O
tell Mental
when O
he O
was O
going_to O
be O
taken BoundedEvent
drunk Property
. O
Mr._Crumb Animate
would O
probably Property
see BoundedEvent
him O
at O
Lodge Object
Meeting Object
the O
next Property
night Mental
. O
If O
he O
was UnboundedEvent
sober Property
, O
which O
was UnboundedEvent
doubtful Property
, O
he O
'd O
have Mental
him O
get_in_touch Agentive
with O
Mr._Crombie Animate
. O
Mr._Blatz Animate
had O
been UnboundedEvent
at_least Property
sober Property
enough Property
to O
remember Mental
to O
telephone Mental
and O
he O
turned_out UnboundedEvent
to O
be UnboundedEvent
the O
greatest Property
boon UnboundedEvent
that O
had O
come UnboundedEvent
into O
Mr._Crombie Animate
's O
life UnboundedEvent
since O
he O
moved BoundedEvent
to O
Highfield Object
, O
in_spite_of O
the O
fact Mental
that O
he O
did O
n't Property
work Agentive
very Property
fast Property
or O
very Property
long Property
at_a_time Property
, O
and O
he O
did O
n't Property
like Mental
to O
work Agentive
at_all Property
unless O
Mr._Crombie Animate
hung_around UnboundedEvent
and O
talked Mental
to O
him O
. O
He O
said Mental
he O
was UnboundedEvent
the O
lonely Property
type Animate
and O
working Agentive
in O
a O
cellar Object
you O
saw Mental
funny Property
things Object
coming BoundedEvent
out O
of O
the O
cracks Object
in O
the O
wall Object
if O
they O
was UnboundedEvent
n't Property
nobody O
with O
you O
. O
So O
Mr._Crombie Animate
sat UnboundedEvent
on O
a O
wooden Property
box Object
and O
talked Mental
in_order O
to O
keep UnboundedEvent
Mr._Blatz Animate
's O
mind Mental
from O
funny Property
things Object
. O
At_the_same_time Property
he O
watched Mental
carefully Property
to O
see Mental
how O
one O
attached UnboundedEvent
pegboards Object
to O
stone Object
walls Object
, O
but O
Mr._Blatz Animate
was O
usually Property
standing UnboundedEvent
in O
his O
line_of_vision Object
and O
it O
all O
seemed Mental
so Property
simple Property
that O
he O
did O
n't Property
like Mental
to O
disclose Mental
his O
ignorance Mental
. O
While O
Mr._Blatz Animate
was O
putting_up UnboundedEvent
the O
pegboards Object
and O
starting BoundedEvent
the O
workbench Object
, O
Mr._Crombie Animate
told Mental
him O
of O
this O
idea Mental
about O
paneling Agentive
the O
whole Property
end Object
of O
the O
cellar Object
. O
Mr._Blatz Animate
agreed Mental
that O
this O
would O
be UnboundedEvent
pretty Property
. O
Without O
further Property
discussion Mental
he O
appeared BoundedEvent
the O
next Property
morning Mental
with O
a O
pile Object
of O
boards Object
sticking Property
over O
the O

of O
his O
light Property

proceeded BoundedEvent
with O
the O
paneling Object

which O
he O
then Property
stained BoundedEvent

waxed UnboundedEvent
according_to O
his O
taste Mental

`` O
Now O

he O
said Mental

`` O

It O

There O

`` O
By_the_way Property

Mr._Blatz Animate

`` O

Mr._Crombie Animate

At_least Property
the O

Mr._Blatz Animate

As_usual Property

Mrs._Crombie Animate
