The O

Indeed O
their O

somewhat Property

We O
speculate Mental

under O

because O
of O
the O

that O

It O

note Mental

Our O
conjecture Mental

that O

The O
fact Mental
that O

thought Mental

a O
vital Property

the O

pattern Mental

failure Agentive

these O

The O
child Animate

high Property

may O
first Property
direct BoundedEvent
his O
anxiety UnboundedEvent
released Property

but O
because O
his O
distress Mental
severely Property
reduces BoundedEvent
the O
abilities Mental

, O
the O
child Animate

fail Agentive

the O

Failure Agentive

the O

the O
intensity Property

increased BoundedEvent

Success Agentive

By O

so_that O
the O
child Animate

At O

The O

We O
may O

his O

that O

The O
engineer Animate

We O
may O

we O

Another Property

given Agentive

also Property
of O

In O
a O

a O
district_manager Animate

been O
recently Property
appointed Agentive

his O
position Agentive
after O
being UnboundedEvent
outstandingly Property

as O
a O

manager Animate

found Mental
that O
in O
supervising Agentive

he O
was O
having Mental
a O
difficult Property
time BoundedEvent

On O
playing Agentive
some O
typical Property
situations UnboundedEvent
before O
a O
jury Object
of O
his O
peers Animate
he O
showed Mental
some O
characteristics Property
rated Mental

unsatisfactory Property

He O
was O
told Mental
he O
displayed Mental
, O
for_example Property
, O
a O
sense Mental
of O
superiority Property

and O
he O
answered Mental

`` O
Well O

I O

are O

? O
He O
was O
criticized Mental

his O
curtness Property

he O
answered Mental

`` O
I O

On O
being O
criticized Mental

`` O
I O

In_short Property

as O
frequently Property
happens BoundedEvent
in O

the O
individual Animate

However Property

in O
this O
case UnboundedEvent
the O
district_manager Animate
was O
led Mental
to O
see Mental
the O
errors Agentive

his O
ways Mental
. O
The O
necessary Property
step Agentive
between O
diagnosis Agentive
and O
training Agentive
is UnboundedEvent
acceptance Mental
of O
the O

of O
the O
criticisms Mental
. O
How O
this O
was O
accomplished Agentive
may O
be O
described Mental
, O
since O
this O
sometimes Property
is UnboundedEvent
a O
crucial Property
problem Mental
. O
The O
director Animate
helped Agentive
tailor-make Agentive
a O
check_list Mental
of O
the O
district_manager Animate

errors Agentive
by O
asking Mental
various Property
observers Animate
to O
write_out Agentive
sentences Mental
commenting Mental

the O
mistakes Agentive
they O
felt Mental

made Agentive

These O
errors Agentive
were O
then Property
collected Mental

written Agentive
on O
a O
blackboard Object

condensing BoundedEvent
similar Property
ideas Mental
. O
Eighteen Property
errors Agentive
were O
located Mental
, O
and O
then Property
the O
director Animate
asked Mental
each O
individual Animate
to O
vote Agentive
whether O
or O
not Property
they O
felt Mental
that O
this O
manager Animate
had O
made Agentive
the O
particular Property
errors Agentive
. O
They O
were O
asked Mental
to O
vote Agentive
`` O
true Property

if O
they O
thought Mental
they O
had O
seen Mental
him O
make Agentive
the O
error Agentive

`` O

if O
they O
thought Mental
he O
had O
not Property
; O
and O
`` O
cannot O
say Mental
'' O
if O
they O
were UnboundedEvent
not Property
certain Property
. O
The O
manager Animate
sat UnboundedEvent
behind O
the O
group Object
so Property
he O
could O
see Mental
and O
count Mental
the O
hands Object
that O
went_up BoundedEvent

and O
the O
director Animate

the O
numbers Property
on O
the O

No O

The O

The O
first Property
eight Property
of O
these O
eighteen Property

which O
received Mental
at_least Property
one-half Mental
of O
the O

were O
duplicated Agentive
to O
form UnboundedEvent
an O

checklist Mental
for O
the O
particular Property
manager Animate

and O
when O
this O
particular Property
manager Animate
roleplayed Agentive
in O
other Property
situations UnboundedEvent
, O
the O
members Animate
checked Mental
any O
items Mental
that O
appeared BoundedEvent

To O
prevent Agentive
the O
manager Animate
from O
deliberately Property
controlling Agentive
himself O
only Property
during O
the O
sessions Agentive
, O
they O
were UnboundedEvent
rather Property
lengthy Property
( O
about O
twenty Property
minutes Mental
) O
, O
the O
situations UnboundedEvent
were O
imperfectly Property
described Mental
to O
the O
manager Animate
so Property
that O
he O
would O
not Property
know Mental
what O
to O
expect Mental
, O
new Property
antagonists Animate
were O
brought BoundedEvent
on O
the O
scene Object
unexpectedly Property
, O
and O
the O
antagonists Animate
were O
instructed Mental
to O
deliberately Property
behave BoundedEvent
in O
such Property
ways Property
as O
to O
upset Mental
the O
manager Animate

get BoundedEvent
him O
to O
operate UnboundedEvent
in O
a O
manner Property
for O
which O
he O
had O
been O
previously Property

After O
every O
session Agentive

the O
check_marks Mental

totaled Mental
up O
and O
graphed Agentive
, O
and O
in O
this O
way Agentive
the O
supervisor Animate

progress Agentive
was O
charted Mental
. O
In O
life Mental
we O
learn Mental
to O
play Agentive
our O
roles Agentive
and O
we O
`` O
freeze BoundedEvent
'' O
into O
patterns Agentive
which O
become BoundedEvent
so Property
habitual Property
that O
we O
are UnboundedEvent
not Property
really Property
aware Property
of O
what O
we O
do Agentive

We O
can O

we O
can O

we O

To O

what O
we O
do Agentive

To O

the O
second Property
step Agentive

To O

the O
third Property
step Agentive

To O
practice Agentive
new Property
procedures Agentive
under O
guided Property
supervision Agentive
and O
with O
constant Property
feedback Mental
is UnboundedEvent
the O
fourth Property
step Agentive
. O
To O
use Agentive
these O
new Property
ways Agentive
in O
daily Property
life UnboundedEvent
is UnboundedEvent
the O
last Property
step Agentive
. O
Roleplaying Agentive
used Property
for O
analysis Agentive
follows Agentive
these O
general Property
steps Agentive
leading UnboundedEvent
to O
training Agentive
. O
When O
an O
evaluative Property
situation UnboundedEvent
is O
set_up Agentive
, O
and O
no O
concern Mental
is UnboundedEvent
with O
the O
details Mental
that O
lead UnboundedEvent
to O
an O
over-all Property
estimate Agentive
, O
we O
say Mental
that O
roleplaying Agentive
is O
used Agentive
for O
evaluation Agentive
. O
Observers Animate
can O
see Mental
a O
person Animate
engaged Mental
in O
spontaneous Property
behavior Agentive
, O
and O
watch Mental
him O
operating UnboundedEvent
in O
a O
totalistic Property
fashion Property
. O
This O
behavior Agentive
is UnboundedEvent
more Property
`` O
veridical Property
'' O
- O
or O
true Property
than O
other Property
testing Agentive
behavior Agentive
for O
some O
types Mental
of O
evaluation Agentive
, O
and O
so O
can O
give Mental
quick Property
and O
accurate Property
estimates Agentive
of O
complex Property
functioning Agentive
. O
While O
roleplaying Agentive
for O
testing Agentive
is O
not Property
too Property
well Property
understood Mental
at O
the O
present Property
time Mental
, O
it O
represents UnboundedEvent
one O
of O
the O
major Property
uses Agentive

this O
procedure Agentive

The O
objective Mental
of O
this O
chapter Mental
is UnboundedEvent
to O
clarify BoundedEvent
the O
distinctions Property
between O
spontaneity Property
theory Mental

other Property
training Agentive
concepts Mental
. O
In_addition Property
, O
the O
basic Property
approach Agentive
utilized Agentive
in O
applying Agentive
roleplaying Agentive
will O
be O
reviewed Mental
. O
The O
goal Mental
will O
be UnboundedEvent
to O
provide Mental
the O
reader Animate
with O
an O
integrated Property
rationale Mental
to O
aid Agentive
him O
in O
applying Agentive
roleplaying Agentive
techniques Mental
in O
this O
unique Property

area UnboundedEvent
. O
The O
reasons Mental
for O
extracting UnboundedEvent
this O
particular Property
roleplaying Agentive
application Agentive
from O
the O
previous Property
discussion Mental
of O
training Agentive
are UnboundedEvent
twofold Property
: O
Spontaneity Property
training Agentive
theory Mental
is UnboundedEvent
unique Property
and O
relatively Property
new Property
. O
It O
is O
not Property
easy Property
for O
the O
therapist Animate
to O
discern Mental
when O
, O
in O
the O
patient Animate

communicating Mental
, O
an O
introject Mental
has O
appeared BoundedEvent
and O
is O
holding_sway Agentive

One O
learns Mental
to O
become BoundedEvent
alert Property
to O
changes BoundedEvent
in O
his O
vocal Property
tone Mental
- O
to O
his O
voice Mental

suddenly Property
shifting BoundedEvent
to O
a O
quality Property
not Property
like O
his O
usual Property
one O
, O
a O
quality Property
which O
sounds Mental
somehow Property
artificial Property
or O
, O
in O
some Property
instances BoundedEvent
, O
parrotlike Property
. O
The O
content Mental
of O
his O
words Mental
may O
lapse BoundedEvent
back Property
into O
monotonous Property
repetition BoundedEvent
, O
as O
if O
a O
phonograph_needle Object
were O
stuck UnboundedEvent
in O
one Property
groove Property
; O
only Property
seldom Property
is UnboundedEvent
it O
so Property
simple Property
as O
to O
be UnboundedEvent
a O
matter Mental
of O
his O
obviously Property
parroting Mental
some Property
timeworn Property
axiom Mental
, O
common Property
to O
our O
culture Object
, O
which O
he O
has O
evidently Property
heard Mental
, O
over_and_over Property
, O
from O
a O
parent Animate
until O
he O
experiences Mental
it O
as O
part UnboundedEvent
of O
him O
. O
One Property
hebephrenic Property
woman Animate
often Property
became BoundedEvent
submerged UnboundedEvent
in O
what O
felt UnboundedEvent
to O
me O
like O
a O
somehow Property
phony Property
experience BoundedEvent
of O
pseudo Property
emotion Mental
, O
during O
which O
, O
despite O
her O
wracking O
sobs Mental
and O
streaming Property
cheeks Object
, O
I O
felt Mental
only Property
a O
cold Property
annoyance UnboundedEvent
with O
her O
. O
Eventually Property
such Property
incidents BoundedEvent
became BoundedEvent
more Property
sporadic Property
, O
and O
more Property
sharply Property
demarcated Mental
from O
her O
day-after-day Property
behavior Agentive
, O
and O
in O
one Property
particular Property
session Mental
, O
after O
several Property
minutes Mental
of O
such Property
behavior Agentive
- O
which O
, O
as_usual Property
, O
went_on BoundedEvent
without O
any O
accompanying Property
words Mental
from O
her O
- O
she O
asked Mental
, O
eagerly Property
, O
`` O
Did O
you O
see Mental
Granny Animate

? O
At_first Property
I O
did O
not Property
know Mental
what O
she O
meant Mental
; O
I O
thought Mental
she O
must O
be O
seeing Mental
me O
as O
some O
one O
who O
had O
just Property
come BoundedEvent
from O
seeing Agentive
her O
grandmother Animate
, O
in O
their O
distant Property
home Property

Then Property
I O
realized Mental
that O
she O
had O
been O
deliberately Property
showing Mental
me O
, O
this O
time BoundedEvent
, O
what O
Granny Animate
was UnboundedEvent
like O
; O
and O
when O
I O
replied Mental
in O
this O
spirit Mental
, O
she O
corroborated Mental
my O
hunch Mental
. O
At O
another Property
phase Mental
in O
the O
therapy Agentive
, O
when O
a O
pathogenic Property
mother Animate
introject Mental
began BoundedEvent
to O
emerge BoundedEvent
more_and_more Property
upon O
the O
investigative Property
scene UnboundedEvent
, O
she O
muttered Mental
in O
a O
low Property
but O
intense Property
voice Property
, O
to O
herself O
, O
`` O
I O
hate Mental
that O
woman Animate
inside O
me O
'' O
! O
I O
could O
evoke Mental
no O
further Property
elaboration Agentive
from O
her O
about O
this O
; O
but O
a_few Property
seconds Mental
later Property
she O
was O
standing UnboundedEvent
directly Property
across O
the O
room Object
from O
me O
, O
looking Mental
me O
in O
the O
eyes Object
and O
saying Mental
in O
a O
scathingly Property
condemnatory Property
tone Mental
, O
`` O
Your O
father Animate
despises Mental
you O
'' O
! O
Again Property
, O
I O
at_first Property
misconstrued Mental
this O
disconcertingly Property
intense Property
communication Mental
, O
and O
I O
quickly Property
cast Mental
through O
my O
mind Mental
to O
account_for Mental
her O
being UnboundedEvent
able Property
to O
speak Mental
, O
with O
such Property
utter Property
conviction Mental
, O
of O
an O
opinion Mental
held Mental
by O
my O
father Animate

now Property
several Property
years Mental
deceased Property

Then Property
I O
replied Mental
, O
coldly Property
, O
`` O
If O
you O
despise Mental
me O
, O
why O
do O

you O

so Property

directly Property

? O
She O
looked BoundedEvent
confused Property
at O
this O

and O
I O
felt Mental
sure Property
it O
had O
been UnboundedEvent
a O
wrong Property
response Mental
for O
me O
to O
make Agentive
. O
It O
then Property
occurred Mental
to O
me O
to O
ask Mental
, O
`` O
Is O
that O
what O
that O
woman Animate
told Mental
you O
'' O
? O
She O
clearly Property
agreed Mental
that O
this O
had O
been UnboundedEvent
the O
case Mental

I O
realized Mental

now Property
, O
that O
she O
had O
been O
showing Mental
me O
, O
in O
what O
impressed Mental
me O
as O
being UnboundedEvent
a O
very Property
accurate Property
way Property
, O
something O
her O
mother Animate
had O
once Property
said Mental
to O
her O
; O
it O
was UnboundedEvent
as O
if O
she O
was O
showing Mental
me O
one Property
of O
the O
reasons Mental
why O
she O
hated Mental
that O

her O
. O
What O
had O
been UnboundedEvent
an O
unmanageably Property
powerful Property
introject Mental
was UnboundedEvent
now Property
, O
despite O
its O
continuing Property
charge Agentive

energy Physical
disconcerting Property
to O
me O
, O
sufficiently Property
within O

of O
her O

that O

use Agentive

what O
this O

Earlier Property

bad Property

cold Property
it O

all_but Property
undrinkable Property

especially Property
that O

She O
was UnboundedEvent
deeply Property

horribly Property
sure Property
that O
Lucien Animate

filled BoundedEvent

She O
had O

she O

if O

not_only Property
the O

She O
felt BoundedEvent

at_the_same_time Property

Now Property
wait UnboundedEvent
a O
minute Mental

she O
told Mental

, O
think_about Mental
it O
; O
Lucien Animate

not Property
the O
only Property
person Animate
in O
this O
house Object
who O
could O
have O
put UnboundedEvent
opium Object
in O
that O
coffee Object
. O
She O
had O
lost Mental
a O
bottle Object
of O
opium Object
- O
but O
that O
was UnboundedEvent
on O
the O
trip Agentive
from O
New_Orleans Object
. O
Or O
someone O
had O
taken Mental
it O
during O
her O
first Property
day Mental
at O
Honotassa Object
. O
Yes O
, O
she O
had O
missed Mental
it O
after O
her O
talk Mental
with O
Emile Animate
, O
after O
dinner Object
, O
just Property
before O
Emile Animate
was O
shot Agentive
. O
Rilly Animate
or O
Glendora Animate
had O
entered BoundedEvent
her O
room Object
while O
she O
slept BoundedEvent
, O
bringing BoundedEvent
back Property
her O
washed Property
clothes Object
. O
So O
somebody O

could O
have O
come_in BoundedEvent
, O
too Property
- O
then Property
or O
later Property
while O
she O
was UnboundedEvent
out O
of O
the O

It O
would O
have O
been UnboundedEvent
easy Property
to O
identify Mental

opium Object

its O

. O
It O
was UnboundedEvent
not Property
very Property
reasonable Property
to O
believe Mental
that O
Lucien Animate

unprocurable Property
opium Object

come_back BoundedEvent

Honotassa Object
with O
a O

plan Mental

murder Agentive

. O
He O
did O
n't Property
even Property

that O
she O

there Property
. O
And O
he O
certainly Property
could O

have O
guessed Mental
that O
she O
would O
resist Agentive
his O
demand Mental
for O
the O
gold Dynamic+Possession
or O
that O
she O
was UnboundedEvent
not Property
the O
yielding Property
- O
yes O
, O
and O
credible Property
fool Animate
he O
had Mental
every O
right Property
to O
expect Mental
. O
No O
, O
he O
had O
been O
surprised Mental
, O
unpleasantly Property
surprised Mental
, O
but O
surprised Mental
. O
Then Property
somebody O
else Property
? O
Do O
n't Property
question Mental
, O
Rev Animate
had O
said Mental
, O
do O
n't Property
invite Mental
danger UnboundedEvent
. O
Her O
skin Object
crawled UnboundedEvent
: O
Lolotte Animate
had O
told Mental
Maude Animate
that O
she O
was UnboundedEvent
in O
the O
hall Object
and O
the O
door Object
was UnboundedEvent
open Property
. O
Sarah Animate
had O
begun BoundedEvent
to O
tell Mental
Lucien Animate
of O
Emile Animate
, O
she O
had O
begun BoundedEvent
to O
question Mental
and O
a O
little Property
draft Physical
had O
crept BoundedEvent
across O
the O
room Object
from O
the O
bedroom Object
door Object
, O
open Property
barely Property
enough Property
to O
show Mental
a O
rim Property
of O
blackness UnboundedEvent
in O
the O
hall Object
. O
So O
Lolotte Animate
- O
or O
anybody O
- O
could O
have O
listened Mental
, O
and O
that O
somebody O
could O
have O
already Property
been UnboundedEvent
supplied_with Property
the O
missing Property
bottle Object
of O
opium Object
. O
That O
was UnboundedEvent
not Property
reasonable Property
either O
. O
The O
opium Object
had O
disappeared BoundedEvent
before O
Emile Animate
's O
death BoundedEvent
and O
whoever O
shot Agentive
him O
could O
not Property
by O
any O
stretch Agentive
of O
the O
imagination Mental
have O
foreseen Mental
Sarah Animate
's O
own Property
doubts Mental
and O
suspicions Mental
- O
and O
questions Mental
. O
She O
began BoundedEvent
to O
doubt Mental
whether O
there O
had O
been UnboundedEvent
in_fact Property
a O
lethal_dose Object
of O
opium Object
in O
the O
cup Object
. O
So O
suppose Mental
somebody O
only Property
wished Mental
to O
frighten Mental
her O
, O
so Property
she O
would O
leave BoundedEvent
Honotassa Object
! O
That O
made Agentive
a O
certain Property
amount Property
of O
logic Mental
. O
Added Property
to O
the O
argument Mental
was UnboundedEvent
the O
fact Mental
that O
while O
she O
might O
have O
tasted Agentive
the O
coffee Object
if O
it O
had O
been UnboundedEvent
still Property
hot Property
, O
she O
might O
even Property
have O
drunk Agentive
some O
of O
it O
, O
she O
would O
n't Property
have O
taken Agentive
enough Property
to O
kill UnboundedEvent
her O
, O
for O
she O
would O
have O
been O
warned Mental
by O
its O
taste Mental
. O
No O
. O
It O
was UnboundedEvent
merely Property
an O
attempt Agentive
to O
frighten Mental
her O
. O
She O
would O
n't Property
go_back BoundedEvent
to O
New_York Object
as O
Maude Animate
suggested Mental
; O
she O
would O
n't Property
run BoundedEvent
like O
a O
scared Property
cat Animate
. O
But O
- O
well O
, O
she O
'd O
be UnboundedEvent
very Property
careful Property
. O
She O
dressed BoundedEvent
and O
the O
accustomed Property
routine Agentive
restored Mental
to O
her O
a O
sense Mental
of O
normal Property
everyday Property
life UnboundedEvent
. O
But O
before O
she O
left BoundedEvent
her O
room Object
she O
dug_into UnboundedEvent
her O
big Property
moire Object
bag Object
, O
took_out UnboundedEvent
the O
envelope Object
holding UnboundedEvent
her O
marriage_contract Mental
and O
the O
wax Object
seal Object
had O
been O
broken BoundedEvent
. O
So O
somebody O
else Property
knew Mental
what O
would O
happen BoundedEvent
to O
her O
father Animate
's O
money Dynamic+Possession
if O
she O
died BoundedEvent
. O
Rev Animate
had O
known Mental
all_along Property
. O
Rev Animate
did O
n't Property
need UnboundedEvent
to O
break BoundedEvent
the O
wax Object
seal Object
, O
read Mental
the O
contract Mental
and O
find_out Mental
. O
He O
could O
conceivably Property
have O
wished Mental
to O
make Agentive
sure Property
; O
Rev Animate
loved Mental
Honotassa Object
, O
it O
was UnboundedEvent
like O
a O
part Object
of O
his O
breath Object
and O
body Object
; O
Rev Animate
had O
stressed Mental
the O
need UnboundedEvent
for O
money Dynamic+Possession
. O
Rev Animate
would O
never Property
have O
tried Agentive
to O
give Mental
her O
poison Object
! O
She O
thrust BoundedEvent
the O
envelope Object
back Property
in O
the O

; O
there O
was UnboundedEvent
no Property
point Mental
in O
locking UnboundedEvent
it O
up O
in O
the O
armoire Object
now Property
, O
it O
was UnboundedEvent
like O
locking UnboundedEvent
the O
barn Object
after O
the O
horse Animate
was O
stolen Mental
. O
And O
in_all_likelihood Property
, O
by O
now Property
, O
there O
was UnboundedEvent
more Property

one Property
person Animate

the O

knew Mental

There O
was UnboundedEvent
no Property

in O

what O
a O

she O

She O
went BoundedEvent

for O
when O
Glendora Animate

Sarah Animate

Why O

Men Animate

she O

even Property

after_all Property

Stanley Animate
really Property

quite Property

That O

He O

The O

He O

upstairs Property
to O

good_night Mental

She O
had O
invited UnboundedEvent
him O
in Property
for O
coffee Object

It O
was UnboundedEvent
in O
the O
kitchen Object

as O
she O
was O
watching Agentive
the O

waiting UnboundedEvent
for O
the O

that O
he O

Without O

without O
giving Mental
her O
a O
chance UnboundedEvent

it O

From O

he O
had O
put UnboundedEvent

on O
her O

, O
turned BoundedEvent
her O
around O
, O
and O
pressed UnboundedEvent
her O

him O

so Property
close Property
she O

Later Property
, O
she O
apologized Mental
for O
the O
long Property

his O

, O
tried Agentive

explain Mental
she O

that O
the O
panic Mental
arose UnboundedEvent
in O
her O
unwanted Property

But O
he O
had O

When O
he O
left BoundedEvent

she O

she O

never Property

Stanley Animate

She O

what O
Stanley Animate

going_to O

ever O
since O
she O
first Property
met Agentive
him O

Except O
for O
that O
one Property
morning Mental

The O
morning Mental
he O
walked BoundedEvent
in Property
to O
announce Mental
to O
her O
, O
blushing Property
, O
that O
he O
was UnboundedEvent
married Property
. O
She O
thought Mental
she O
was O
going_to O

She O
had O
assumed Mental
before O
then O
that O
one Property

he O
would O
ask Mental
her O
to O

him O
. O
Blanche Animate
could O
n't Property
remember Mental
when O
she O
had O
first Property
arrived BoundedEvent
at O
this O
conclusion Mental
. O
She O
thought Mental
it O
was O
sometime Property
during O
the O
second Property
week Mental
she O
worked Agentive
for O
Stanley Animate
. O
It O
was O
nothing Mental
that O
he O
said Mental
or O
did Agentive
, O
but O
it O
seemed Mental
so Property
natural Property
to O
her O
that O
she O
should O
be O
working Agentive
for O
him O
, O
looking_forward Mental
to O
his O
eventual Property
proposal Mental
. O
She O
was UnboundedEvent
thirty-one O
years Mental
old Property
then Property
. O
Her O
mother Animate
was UnboundedEvent
already Property
considerably Property
concerned Property
over O
her O
daughter Animate

future Mental
. O
But O
Blanche Animate
had O
been O
able Property
to O
maintain Agentive
a O
serene Property
and O
assured Property
composure Property
in O
the O
face Agentive
of O
her O
widowed Property
mother Animate

continued Property
carping Mental
, O
had O
been UnboundedEvent
able Property
to O
resist UnboundedEvent
her O
urgings Mental
to O
date Agentive
anyone O
who O
offered Mental
the O
slightest Property
possibility Mental
of O
matrimony UnboundedEvent

For O
Blanche Animate
, O
it O
was O
only Property
a O
matter Mental
of O
time Mental
before O
Stanley Animate
would O
propose Mental
. O
It O
was O
to_be_expected O
that O
Stanley Animate
would O
be UnboundedEvent
shy Property
, O
slow Property
in O
taking Agentive
such Property
a O
momentous Property
step Agentive
. O
Stanley Animate
went_along UnboundedEvent
in O
life Mental
, O
she O
knew Mental
, O
convinced Property
that O
he O
deserved UnboundedEvent
the O
love Mental
and O
faith Mental
of O
no O
woman Animate
. O
As_a_result O
, O
he O
never Property
looked_for UnboundedEvent
it O
. O
But O
one Property
day Mental
, O
she O
expected Mental
, O
he O
would O
somehow Property
discover Mental
, O
without O
her O
having_to O
tell Mental
him O
, O
that O
there O
was O
such Property
a O

the O

a O

who O
was UnboundedEvent
willing Property

and O
anything O
else Property
a O

could O
give Mental
a O

Indeed Property

there O
was O
a O

who O
, O
unasked Property

had O
already Property
given Mental
him O
love Mental

Unquestionably Property
, O
Blanche Animate
loved Mental
Stanley Animate

And_then Property
, O
unexpectedly Property
, O
Stanley Animate
made O
his O
announcement Mental
. O
On O
that O
first Property
day Mental
, O
Blanche Animate
literally Property
thought Mental
she O
was O
going_to O
die BoundedEvent

or O
, O
at Property
the O
very Property
least O
, O
go O
out O
of O
her O
mind Mental
. O
It O
might O
have O
been UnboundedEvent
easier Property
for O
her O
if O
Kitti_Walker Animate

n't Property
been UnboundedEvent
everything O
that O
Blanche Animate

not Property

Kitti Animate
was UnboundedEvent
thirty Property

younger Property

taller Property

Stanley Animate

prettier Property
than O
Stanley Animate
had Mental
any O
right Property
to O
hope Mental

, O
much_less O

. O
Kitti Animate
could O
have O
married Agentive
a O
score Object
of O

There O
was O
no O
reason Mental
for O
her O
to O
marry Agentive
someone O
like O
Stanley_Gilborn Animate
, O
there O
was O
no O
need UnboundedEvent
for O
her O
to O
marry Agentive
Stanley Animate

Kitti Animate
had O
come BoundedEvent
into O
the O
office Object
, O
on O
somebody O
's O
recommendation Mental
, O
because O
she O
needed Agentive
help Agentive
in O
preparing Agentive
her O
income_tax_return Mental
. O
Stanley Animate
had O
filled_out Mental
the O
return Mental
and O
because O
, O
when O
he O
was UnboundedEvent
finished Property
, O
it O
was O
close Property
to O
the O
lunch Object
hour Mental
, O
he O
had O
politely Property
asked Mental
Kitti Animate
to O
join Agentive
him O
, O
never Property
expecting Mental
her O
to O
accept Mental
. O
Blanche Animate
knew Mental
all O
this O
because O
the O
door Object
to O
Stanley Animate

office Object
was UnboundedEvent
open Property
and O
, O
without O
straining Agentive
too Property
hard Property
, O
she O
could O
hear Mental
everything O
that O

said Mental
. O
Stanley Animate
had O
gone_out BoundedEvent

saying Mental
he O
would O
be UnboundedEvent
back Property
in O
an O
hour Mental
. O
He O
had O
n't Property
come_back BoundedEvent
for O
over O

After O
that O
day Mental
, O
Blanche Animate
still Property
did O
n't Property
know Mental
exactly Property
what O
had O
happened BoundedEvent

There O
were O
mornings Mental
when O
Stanley Animate
came_in BoundedEvent

afternoons Mental
when O
he O
left BoundedEvent
early Property

days Mental
when O
he O
did O

come_in BoundedEvent

Blanche Animate
knew Mental
something O
must O
be O
causing Agentive
Stanley Animate

new Property

strange Property
behavior Agentive
but O
she O
never Property
once Property
connected Mental
it O
with O
Kitti_Walker Animate

It O
was UnboundedEvent

Then Property
, O
six Property

the O

Kitti Animate

the O

Stanley Animate

Somehow Property

That O
night Mental
the O

While O

running Agentive

On O

She O
