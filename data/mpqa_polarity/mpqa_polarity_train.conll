"We	O

I	O

went B-neutral
even I-neutral

The	O
deputy	O
said	O
that	O
Powell's	O
remarks	O
did B-neutral
not I-neutral
surprise I-neutral
him	O
and	O
added	O
that	O
the	O
US	O

opinion B-neutral
is	O
based	O
on	O
reports	O
published	O
by	O
the	O
domestic	O

press,	O
which	O
is	O
waging B-negative
a I-negative
ruthless I-negative
war I-negative
against I-negative
the	O
Venezuelan	O
chief	O
of	O
state.	O

He	O
noted:	O
"The	O
opposition	O
is B-negative
succeeding I-negative

Carreno	O
excused B-uncertain-positive
the	O

He	O
took	O
one	O

step	O

invited B-positive
Powell	O
to	O
visit	O
Venezuela	O
to B-neutral

what I-neutral
is I-neutral
really I-neutral
happening I-neutral
.	O

He	O
accused B-negative
the	O
four	O

plotting B-negative

powerful	O

presumably B-neutral
contributed	O
the	O

Apparently B-neutral
President	O

a I-neutral

American	O

that	O
the	O

a	O
part B-neutral
of I-neutral
the I-neutral
American I-neutral
psyche I-neutral

This	O
can B-neutral
be I-neutral
traced I-neutral
back	O
to	O
the	O

1818,	O

Since	O
then,	O
the	O
United	O

has B-neutral
been I-neutral
raising I-neutral
artificial I-neutral

preservation B-positive
of I-positive

human I-positive

and	O
developing	O

The B-neutral
actual I-neutral

not I-neutral

According B-neutral

the	O
analysis	O
of	O
Chomsky,	O
after	O
World	O
War	O
II,	O
the	O

that	O
the	O

without B-neutral

the	O

possible I-neutral
that	O
the B-neutral
United I-neutral

itself I-neutral
planned B-neutral
this	O

this I-negative

which	O
the	O

After	O

the	O

completely B-negative

the B-neutral
reason I-neutral
for	O

The	O
rule,	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
human	O

are	O
concerned,	O
is	O

that	O
every	O

for	O
her	O

what	O

the	O

All	O

which	O

seemingly	O

refraining	O

so	O
not	O
so	O
much	O

to	O
escape	O
being	O

rather	O

neither	O
the	O
knowledge	O
nor	O
the	O
money	O
to	O
join	O
the	O

Come	O
to	O
think	O
of	O
it,	O
acquiring	O
weapons	O
of	O
mass	O

per	O

se	O
may B-sentiment-negative

basis I-sentiment-negative
for	O
judging	O
whether	O

good	O

The	O
mere B-sentiment-negative
development	O
or	O
possession	O
of	O

is	O
not	O
in	O
itself	O
a	O
reason	O
to	O
label	O

as	O

After	O
all,	O
the	O

the	O

is	O
the	O
first	O
and	O

only	O
nation	O
ever	O
to	O
deploy	O
such	O
weapons.	O

Perhaps	O
the	O
real	O
criterion	O
in	O
this	O
context	O
is	O
whether	O
the	O

nuclear	O
country	O
is	O
democratic	O

that	O
its	O

is	O
being	O
threatened	O
only	O
when	O
the	O
nations	O

which	O
acquire	O
mass	O
destruction	O
weapons	O
are	O
authoritarian B-sentiment-negative

repressive I-sentiment-negative
,	O
irrespective	O
of	O
the	O
pace	O
of	O
amassing	O
weaponry.	O

This	O

is,	O
in	O
fact,	O
the B-negative
fear I-negative
of	O
all	O
countries,	O
as	O
they	O
feel B-positive
that	O

democratic	O

are	O
more B-sentiment-positive

responsible I-sentiment-positive

If	O
this	O
