If B-neutral

which	O

President	O

this	O
alternative	O

who	O
deemed B-negative
it	O

reproached B-negative
it	O
for	O
imposing B-negative

Contrary B-neutral

the	O

Mr.	O

"There	O

Carl	O
Pope,	O
the	O

the	O
Sierra	O

considers B-neutral
for	O
his	O
part	O
that	O
the	O

"is	O
sticking B-negative

According	O

clear I-neutral
that	O
the B-neutral

sufficient I-negative

The	O

not B-negative

On B-neutral
the I-neutral

,	O
the	O
Kyoto	O

requires	O
most	O

The B-neutral

The	O
first	O

40	O
years	O

was	O
the	O
Soviet	O

who	O
saw	O
that	O
the	O

the	O

the	O
earth's	O

inexorably B-negative
moving	O

the	O

Participants	O
in	O
the B-neutral

also	O
proceeded	O

100	O

It B-neutral
is I-neutral
another I-neutral

that	O
the	O

for	O
this	O

are	O
not B-neutral
completely I-neutral
clear I-neutral
,	O
and	O
experts	O
offer	O
different	O
interpretations	O
of	O
the	O

global	O

Rumor	O
has	O
it	O
that	O
the	O
late	O
author	O
of	O
the	O
greenhouse	O
model	O
told	O
Academician	O
Roald	O
Sagdeyev:	O
"I'm	O
a B-negative
little I-negative
uneasy I-negative
when	O
I	O
tell	O
the	O
Americans	O
about	O
my	O

because	O
it	O
suggests B-neutral
that	O
Russia's	O
agriculture	O
will	O
gain	O
from	O
global	O

while	O
America's	O
agriculture	O
will	O

Sagdeyev	O
looked B-neutral
at I-neutral
Budyko I-neutral
with I-neutral
interest I-neutral
:	O
"But	O
then	O
where	O
will	O
we	O
buy	O
grain?"	O

And	O
now	O
Andrey	O
Gudkov,	O
an	O
expert	O
at	O
the	O
Center	O
for	O
Strategic	O
Studies,	O
follows	O
Budyko	O
in	O
insisting B-neutral
that	O
Russia,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
Canada	O

Alaska,	O
gain,	O
since	O
"lands	O

gradually	O
turn	O

But	O
the	O
rich	O
Russian	O
fields	O
that	O

the	O

are	O
small B-neutral
comfort I-neutral

humankind	O
as	O
a	O

so	O
Gudkov	O
proposes	O
blocking	O
off	O

an	O
umbrella	O
that	O
would	O
be	O
suspended	O

The	O

immediately	O
sketched	O
on	O
a	O

what	O
this	O
should	O
look	O

mixing	O

the B-neutral

the	O

"since	O

In	O

Kapitsa	O

In	O
his	O

it	O
would B-positive

Those	O

that I-neutral

that	O
is,	O
if	O

you	O

True B-neutral

Some	O
of	O
the	O

took B-neutral
the I-neutral
line I-neutral
that	O
this	O
is	O
an	O
extremely B-neutral
useful I-neutral
for	O
Russia,	O
which	O
has	O
"hot	O

(that	O

30	O

the	O

consequently B-neutral

it	O

a	O
greater B-neutral

anyone I-neutral
in	O
the	O
ratification	O
of	O

We	O

So	O
if	O
anyone	O

whether	O

he	O
is	O
deeply B-negative

we	O

This	O

based	O
on	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
Russia's	O

today	O
are	O
almost	O
25	O

emissions	O
and	O
emission	O

as	O

This	O
requires	O
creating	O
a	O

the	O
creation	O

a	O

is	O
neither B-neutral
very I-neutral

"It	O
is	O
analogous B-neutral
to	O
the	O
US	O

on	O

Ma	O

The	O

that	O

the	O

the	O

Apart	O

What B-neutral
is I-neutral
most I-neutral
interesting I-neutral
about	O
the	O
reports	O
is	O
the	O
section	O
on	O
Israel.	O

Since	O
Israel	O
suffers B-negative
from	O

the	O
report	O

it	O
has	O
been	O
forced B-negative

take	O
counter-terrorism	O
measures,	O
making	O
its	O

at B-neutral
all I-neutral

The	O
report	O
is	O
generally B-positive
quite I-positive
frank I-positive
and	O
its	O
wording B-uncertain-neutral
strong I-uncertain-neutral
,	O
but	O
it	O
proposes	O
no	O
corrective	O
action.	O

Consolidating	O
the	O
anti-terrorist	O

and	O
expanding	O
the	O
war	O
against	O

are	O
overshadowing B-negative
concerns B-negative

In	O
exchange	O
for	O
support B-positive
for I-positive
its B-negative
war I-negative

the	O
US	O

tacitly B-negative
agreeing I-negative
to I-negative
ignore I-negative
abuses I-negative
by	O
other	O
members	O

the	O

The	O
most B-negative
glaring I-negative

Russia's	O

Israel's	O

Six	O

passed	O
since	O
Sept.	O

the	O
focus	O

"	O

The	O

the	O
US	O
interpretation B-negative

Put B-neutral
simply I-neutral

what B-neutral
we I-neutral
are I-neutral
seeing I-neutral
is	O
the	O
naked B-negative

No B-uncertain-negative

To	O
earn	O
legitimacy B-positive

however B-neutral
,	O
US	O

made B-uncertain-negative

just I-uncertain-negative

Even B-neutral
though I-neutral
almost	O
all	O

a	O
lack B-negative

Demonizing B-negative
the I-negative

will B-neutral
guarantee I-neutral
that	O
peace B-negative

not I-negative

gained I-negative
through I-negative

The	O
report	O
expressly B-neutral
points	O
out	O
that,	O
"It	O
is	O
extremely B-negative

To	O

in I-uncertain-neutral
the I-uncertain-neutral

the	O
US	O
must B-neutral

If,	O

the	O
breeding B-negative
ground I-negative
for	O
terrorists	O
that	O

the	O

Such B-negative

compromising B-positive
