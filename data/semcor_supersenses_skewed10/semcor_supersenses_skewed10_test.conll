a	3

Again	0

I	3
at	3

I	3
quickly	1

It	2

The	3
wastebasket	0
stood	1
near	1
the	4
wall	1
next	1
to	3
the	4
divan	0
,	4
and	3
the	4
instant	1
Casey	0
picked	1
it	3
up	2
he	3
knew	1
what	2
had	3
happened	1
.	4

The	3
discarded	0
papers	0
inside	1
were	2
sodden	0
,	4
there	2
was	3
a	3
glint	0
of	3
liquid	1
at	3
the	4
bottom	1
,	4
and	3
the	4
smell	1
of	3
whisky	1
was	3
strong	1
and	3
distinct	1
.	4

He	2
put	1
the	4
basket	0
down	2
distastefully	0
,	4
muttering	0
softly	1
and	3
thoroughly	0
disgusted	0
with	3
himself	2
and	3
his	3
plan	1
that	3
had	3
seemed	1
so	2
foolproof	0
.	4

For	2
he	3
remembered	1
too	2
well	2
how	2
he	3
had	3
brought	1
back	2
the	4
loaded	0
drinks	0
to	3
Burton	0
and	3
then	2
returned	1
to	3
the	4
kitchen	1
to	3
get	2
weaker	0
drinks	0
for	3
himself	2
.	4

For	2
another	2
second	1
or	3
two	2
he	3
gave	1
in	3
to	3
the	4
annoyance	0
that	3
was	3
directed	1
at	3
himself	2
;	2
then	2
his	3
mind	1
moved	1
on	3
to	3
be	3
confronted	1
by	3
something	2
far	2
more	2
serious	1
,	4
and	3
as	3
the	4
thought	2
expanded	0
,	4
the	4
implications	0
jarred	0
him	2
.	4

It	2
no	2
longer	1
mattered	0
that	3
Burton	0
had	3
outsmarted	0
him	2
.	4

The	3
important	2
thing	1
was	3
that	3
Burton	0
had	3
gone	1
somewhere	0
to	3
meet	1
a	3
blackmailer	0
with	3
a	3
gun	1
in	3
his	3
pocket	1
.	4

And	2
that	3
gun	1
was	3
empty	1
.	4

Even	1
before	2
his	3
mind	1
had	3
rounded	0
out	2
the	4
idea	1
,	4
he	3
thrust	0
one	2
hand	2
into	2
his	3
trousers	0
pocket	1
and	3
pulled	1
out	2
the	4
six	1
slugs	0
he	3
had	3
taken	1
from	3
the	4
revolver	0
.	4

He	2
considered	1
them	2
with	3
brooding	0
eyes	2
,	4
brows	0
bunched	0
as	3
his	3
brain	1
grappled	0
with	3
the	4
problem	1
and	3
tried	1
to	3
find	2
some	2
solution	1
.	4

He	2
said	2
:	2
``	3
The	3
crazy	1
fool	1
''	3
,	4
half	1
aloud	0
.	4

He	2
put	1
the	4
shells	0
on	3
the	4
table	1
,	4
as	3
though	2
he	3
could	2
no	2
longer	1
bear	1
to	3
hold	1
them	2
.	4

He	2
thought	2
:	2
Where	1
the	4
hell	1
could	2
he	3
have	2
gone	1
?	2

How	1
can	2
I	3
find	2
him	2
?	2

There	2
was	3
no	2
answer	1
to	3
this	2
and	3
he	3
began	1
to	3
pace	0
back	2
and	3
forth	1
across	1
the	4
room	1
,	4
his	3
imagination	1
out	2
of	3
control	1
.	4

He	2
tried	1
to	3
tell	1
himself	2
that	3
maybe	0
Burton	0
had	3
sobered	0
up	2
enough	2
to	3
get	2
some	2
sense	1
.	4

Maybe	0
he	3
only	2
intended	0
to	3
scare	0
the	4
blackmailer	0
,	4
whoever	0
he	3
was	3
,	4
in	3
which	2
case	1
an	2
unloaded	0
gun	1
would	2
be	3
good	2
enough	2
.	4

He	2
thought	2
of	3
other	2
possibilities	1
,	4
none	1
of	3
them	2
satisfactory	1
,	4
and	3
finally	1
he	3
began	1
to	3
think	2
,	4
to	3
wonder	1
if	2
there	2
was	3
some	2
way	2
he	3
could	2
reach	1
Burton	0
.	4

Then	2
,	4
as	3
he	3
turned	1
toward	1
the	4
telephone	1
,	4
it	3
rang	0
shrilly	0
to	3
shatter	0
the	4
stillness	0
in	3
the	4
room	1
and	3
he	3
reached	1
for	3
it	3
eagerly	0

he	3
knew	1
who	2

it	3

make	2

control	1
the	4

called	2
the	4
bar	1

where	2
he	3
had	3
picked	1
Burton	0
up	2
that	3
afternoon	1

When	2
he	3
was	3

that	3

he	3

Casey	0

scared	0
for	3
a	3

that	3

out	2
