Several	0
years	3

I	4
developed	1
a	5
short	2
paper	1

pencil	0
screening	0
test	2
which	3
,	5
in	4
a	5
small	2
pilot	1
study	1
,	5
discriminated	0
between	2
ADHD	0
,	5
LD	0
,	5
and	5
control	2
subjects	0
.	5

I	4
recently	2
converted	0
this	4
test	2
to	5
an	3
online	1
test	2
in	4
order	2
to	5
norm	0
it	4
to	5
a	5
larger	1
population	1
and	5
,	5
subsequently	0
,	5
to	5
make	3
it	4

any	3
one	3
who	3
has	3
access	2
to	5
a	5
computer	1
and	5
the	5
Internet	0

The	4
test	2
itself	2
is	4
what	3
is	4
called	2
a	5
substitution	0
test	2
.	5

It	3
has	3
two	3
parts	1
,	5
both	2
of	5
which	3
are	4
timed	0
for	4
90	1
seconds	0
each	2
and	5
the	5
differential	0
between	2
the	5
resulting	1
two	3
scores	0
determines	0
the	5
likelihood	0

having	2
a	5
learning	1

attention	1

.	5

I	4
am	3
in	4
need	3

hope	2
you	4

take	3
it	4

test	2

along	2

an	3
information	2
form	2

I	4
think	3
a	5
test	2
like	3
this	4

is	4
much	3
needed	2

A	3

can	3
take	3
it	4
