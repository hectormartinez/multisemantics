that	4

On	2
sensing	0
my	4
incredulity	0
to	5
his	3
statement	1
he	4
asserted	0
that	4
Ba'athist	0
cells	1
exist	1
in	4
all	3
parts	1
of	5
the	5
country	2
and	5
that	4
they	4
do	4
have	4
a	5
central	1
command	1

even	3
though	2
many	3
have	4
formed	1

cells	1
(	4
often	2
under	2
Islamic	1
labels	0
)	4
with	4
their	3
own	2

He	3
said	3
that	4

the	5
training	1

well	3
as	4
the	5

I	4
concur	0
that	4
Ba'athists	0

immediately	1

But	2
I	4
also	3
see	3
that	4
as	4
a	5
fatal	0
misconception	0
,	5
which	3
is	4
doing	2
Sunnis	0

because	3

believe	2
the	5

anywhere	1

soon	2

Any	2
government	2
that	4
assumes	0
power	2
after	3
the	5

also	3

this	4

so	3
not	4
even	3
Sistani	1
is	4
going	3

call	3

withdraw	0
its	3
troops	1

despite	1
what	3
he	4

until	2
they	4

ensured	0
the	5

out	3

I	4
have	4
also	3
purchased	1
an	3
Appel	0
in	4
the	5
last	2
month	2

I	4
am	3
interested	2
in	4
several	2
artists	0

Actually	1
,	5
a	5
lot	2

I	4
will	4
be	4
looking	2
for	4
one	3
or	4
more	3
of	5
the	5
following	2
.	5

My	3
concept	0
is	4
that	4
over	3
time	3
I	4
would	3
like	3
to	5
own	2
one	3
of	5
all	3
the	5
following	2
artists	0
and	5
they	4
are	4
all	3
depending	1
when	3
I	4
find	2
something	2
that	4
we	3
really	3
like	3
.	5

I	4
listed	1
all	3
of	5

(	4
sometimes	1
mine	1
vs.	1
my	4
wife	2

favorites	0

.	5

They	3
are	4
kind	2
of	5
in	4
rank	0
order	2
but	3
as	4
I	4
stated	1
if	3
I	4
find	2
the	5
piece	2
that	4
I	4
like	3
we	3
will	4
purchase	1
it	4
.	5

I	4
want	3
signed	2
and	5
numbered	0
.	5

I	4
realize	1
that	4
some	3
were	3
not	4
signed	2
by	3
the	5
artist	0
but	3
it	4
is	4
an	3
important	2
fact	2
in	4
my	4
buying	1
decision	1

I	4
also	3
realize	1
that	4
some	3

done	2
any	3

or	4
they	4
are	4
outrageously	0

if	3

By	2

I	4
am	3
interested	2
in	4
re-looking	0
at	4
a	5
Picasso	0
(	4
although	2
we	3
have	4
2	3
)	4
that	4
your	4
gallery	0
had	3
a	5
couple	2
of	5
years	3
ago	2
.	5

It	3
was	4
a	5
cubist	0
piece	2
from	4
the	5
1920s	0
and	5
I	4
believe	2
you	4
called	2

"	4
(	4
pronunciation	0

an	3
attempt	1
at	4

It	3
was	4
for	4
sale	1
in	4
a	5
couple	2
of	5
galleries	0
in	4
SF	0
and	5
was	4
about	3
$	3
20,000	1

Is	2
there	3
1	2
available	2
?	4

Also	2
I	4
am	3
still	3
thinking	1
about	3
the	5
Matisse	0
we	3
discussed	1
before	3
but	3
as	4
you	4
can	3
see	3
,	5
I	4
have	4
a	5
lot	2
of	5
other	3

I	4
am	3
interested	2

it	4
may	3

The	4
pricing	1

we	3

show	2

to	5
get	3
some	3
press	2

but	3
I	4
wonder	1
about	3
the	5
most	3
appropriate	1
timing	1
,	5
enough	2
of	5
a	5
global	2
message	2
and	5
the	5
means	2
of	5
delivery	1
.	5

On	2
the	5
means	2
of	5
delivery	1
,	5
I	4
am	3
not	4
sure	2
from	4
your	4
note	2
whether	2
or	4
not	4
I	4
fully	1
understand	2
the	5
intent	0
.	5

Is	2
there	3
an	3
article	1
to	5
be	4
included	1
in	4
an	3
Enron	2
publication	0
and	5
in	4
addition	1
a	5
letter	2
to	5
be	4
sent	2
under	2
John	2
's	4
name	2
(	4
if	3
so	3
,	5
to	5
whom	1
will	4
the	5
letter	2
be	4
sent	2
)	4
?	4

Or	1
is	4
the	5
letter	2
from	4
John	2
an	3
introduction	0
to	5
be	4
included	1
as	4
a	5
lead	1
in	4
to	5
the	5
article	1
?	4

With	2
regard	1
to	5
a	5
global	2
message	2
,	5
I	4
think	3
that	4
one	3
of	5
the	5
key	2
points	2
around	2
fundamental	1
operating	1
standards	1
are	4
that	4
they	4
are	4
intended	1
to	5
be	4
global	2
in	4
nature	1
,	5
applied	1
to	5
every	2
commodity	0
and	5
every	2
location	1
where	2
we	3
engage	0
in	4
trading	1
activities	2
.	5

With	2
these	3
operating	1
standards	1
implemented	1
worldwide	1
,	5
we	3
will	4
know	3
as	4
operations	1
professionals	0
that	4
risk	2
is	4
being	3
mitigated	0
and	5
we	3
will	4
be	4
able	2
to	5
ensure	1
Enron	2
top	2
management	1
that	4
there	3
is	4
consistency	0
in	4
operating	1
standards	1
worldwide	1
.	5

These	2
global	2
standards	1
also	3
should	3
enable	0
Enron	2
to	5
expand	0
its	3
business	2
reach	1
more	3
quickly	2
,	5
with	4
well	3
defined	1
requirements	1
with	4
regard	1
to	5
trading	1
operations	1
.	5

I	4
am	3
not	4
sure	2
from	4
the	5
article	1
as	4
written	1
that	4
the	5
global	2
nature	1
of	5
this	4
effort	1
comes	2
across	2
.	5

Finally	1
,	5
a	5
question	2
regarding	2
timing	1
.	5

The	4
last	2
I	4
knew	1
after	3
you	4
and	5
Brent	0
drafted	0
this	4
starting	1
point	2
for	4
fundamental	1
operating	1
standards	1
was	4
that	4
this	4
was	4
being	3
circulated	0
(	4
Shona	0
took	2
this	4
to	5
do	4
after	3
Brent	0
's	4
return	2
to	5
Houston	2
)	4
for	4
comments	2
to	5
all	3
business	2
controllers	0
.	5

I	4
do	4
n't	4
believe	2
that	4
we	3
are	4
quite	2
at	4
the	5
point	2
that	4
we	3
can	3
say	3
that	4
all	3
business	2
controllers	0
worldwide	1
have	4
reviewed	0
,	5
understand	2
and	5
have	4
implemented	1
these	3
standards	1
.	5

And	2
not	4
to	5
belittle	0
the	5
process	2
of	5
creating	1
the	5
standards	1
,	5
the	5
tough	1
part	2
(	4
and	5
the	5
real	2
meat	1
behind	2
this	4
)	4
will	4
be	4
an	3
effective	1
exception	1
report	2
on	4
a	5
global	2
basis	1
against	2
these	3
standards	1
.	5

My	3
commitment	0
to	5
Rick	1
Causey	0
is	4
that	4
I	4
will	4
have	4
that	4
global	2
report	2
in	4
production	1
by	3
the	5
end	2
of	5
the	5
year	3
.	5

There	2
is	4
much	3
work	3
to	5
do	4
in	4
defining	0
the	5
content	1
and	5
regularity	0
of	5
the	5
report	2
and	5
even	3
more	3
work	3
to	5
do	4
to	5
identify	0
reliable	1
sources	1
of	5
data	1
for	4
compiling	0
the	5
report	2
.	5

Shona	0
has	3
commissioned	0
Mike	2
Moscoso	0
to	5
work	3
on	4

and	5
I	4
believe	2
that	4
Mike	2
has	3
already	2
been	3
working	2
with	4
James	1
New	2
.	5

So	2
I	4
question	2
whether	2
or	4
not	4
you	4
want	3
to	5
publish	0
info	1
about	3
fundamental	1

that	4
we	3

Would	1

after	3
the	5
Global	1

we	3

these	3

and	5
(	4
hopefully	1
)	4
our	3
first	3

I	4

There	2
are	4
still	3
four	2

however	2
:	3

IT	2
still	3
can	3
not	4
commit	1
to	5
transferring	0
messages	1
across	2
domains	0
.	5

This	3
means	2
that	4
messages	1
initiated	1
at	4
Corp	1
and	5
intended	1
for	4
the	5
entire	2
Enron	2
organization	1
will	4
not	4
reach	1
any	3

No	2

Another	1
thing	2

is	4
that	4
these	3

set	2

within	2

them	3
later	2
(	4
as	4
they	4

that	4

I	4
'm	3
working	2
on	4
it	4
now	3
.	5

Maybe	1
we	3
(	4
Enron	2
)	4
could	3
review	2
it	4
tomorrow	2
morning	2
,	5
then	3
send	2
it	4
to	5
FCE	0
.	5

I	4
can	3
meet	2
around	2
10:00	0
.	5

That	2
way	3
,	5
we	3
can	3
get	3
it	4
to	5
them	3
in	4
time	3
for	4
weekend	2
review	2
.	5

Does	1
that	4
work	3
?	4

Kay	2

It	3
was	4
good	3
to	5
hear	2
from	4
you	4
!	3

We	3
had	3
a	5
nice	2
Thanksgiving	0
here	3
too	2
.	5

It	3
's	4
funny	0
,	5
because	3
usually	2
it	4
's	4
just	3
me	3
,	5
Mom	1
,	5
Craig	1
and	5
Danelia	0
,	5
and	5
Danelia	0
does	3
n't	4
really	3
like	3
roasted	0
turkey	0
or	4
roast	0
beef	0
(	4
not	4
that	4
she	3
would	3
say	3
it	4
to	5
me	3
!	3
)	4
,	5
so	3
there	3
is	4
not	4
just	3
the	5
same	3
joy	0
in	4
cooking	0
it	4
would	3
be	4
elsewise	0
.	5

It	3
was	4
good	3
having	2
the	5
girls	1
down	2
.	5

We	3
played	1
a	5
new	3
version	1
of	5
Uno	0
called	2
"	4
African	0
Uno	0
"	4
that	4
was	4
complex	1
,	5
fast	1
and	5
at	4
times	2
,	5
physically	0
challenging	1
.	5

It	3
's	4
not	4
for	4
the	5
meek	0
.	5

It	3
was	4
incredible	0
what	3
a	5
good	3
player	1
Alena	0
was	4
.	5

She	2
had	3
her	3
cards	1
memorized	0
as	4
well	3
as	4
everyone	2
else	2
s	3
(	4
when	3
you	4
play	2
you	4
'll	3
see	3
why	2
you	4
can	3
know	3
everyone	2
else	2
s	3
hands	1
!	3
)	4
.	5

I	4
expect	2
Craig	1
did	3
n't	4
want	3
Mom	1
to	5
see	3
his	3
place	3
because	3
it	4
was	4
messy	0
.	5

I	4
think	3
compared	1
to	5
my	4
house	2
,	5
he	4
's	4
embarrased	0
about	3
his	3
apartment	1
.	5

Then	2
,	5
also	3
,	5
he	4
's	4
got	3
so	3
much	3
stuff	1
in	4
there	3
right	2
now	3
,	5
that	4
I	4
do	4
n't	4
know	3
how	3
he	4
's	4
going	3
to	5
fit	1
baby	2
stuff	1
.	5

They	3
would	3
only	3
give	2
him	3
a	5
6	2
month	2
lease	1
when	3
he	4
renewed	1
his	3
lease	1
last	2
month	2
because	3
they	4
do	4
n't	4
want	3
3	3
people	3
in	4
that	4
small	2
apartment	1
.	5

So	2
he	4
's	4
going	3
to	5
have	4
to	5
start	2
looking	2
for	4
another	2
place	3
.	5

And	2
his	3
apartment	1
is	4
so	3
run	2
down	2
down	2
I	4
'm	3
afraid	1
roaches	0
might	2
be	4
crawling	0
over	3
the	5
baby	2
.	5

I	4
guess	2
Mom	1
is	4
going	3
to	5
come	2
back	3
down	2
sometime	1
in	4
March	2
or	4
April	2
to	5
see	3
the	5
new	3
baby	2
.	5

You	3
'll	3
have	4
to	5
come	2
visit	2
to	5
check	2
out	3
my	4
new	3
house	2

Hey	1
there	3
yourself	2

Sorry	1
I	4
have	4
n't	4
written	1
you	4
guys	2
in	4
a	5
while	2
to	5
keep	2
you	4
properly	1
updated	1
.	5

I	4
am	3
indeed	1
checking	1
on	4
flights	0
to	5
Seoul	0
and	5
do	4
n't	4
think	3
I	4
'm	3
going	3
to	5
go	3
at	4
exactly	1
the	5
same	3
time	3
as	4
my	4
parents	2
.	5

As	2
much	3
fun	2
as	4
they	4
are	4
,	5
I	4
figured	1
we	3
would	3
probably	2
do	4
some	3
different	2
things	2
than	3
what	3
you	4
have	4
planned	1
for	4
them	3
.	5

As	2
for	4
Ted	1
,	5
things	2
are	4
still	3
going	3
well	3
although	2
I	4
have	4
n't	4
see	3
him	3
at	4
all	3
this	4
week	2
(	4
we	3
are	4
two	3
very	3
busy	1
people	3
)	4
.	5

But	2
,	5
we	3
had	3
a	5
great	3
laid	0
back	3
day	3
last	2
Saturday	1
and	5
I	4
think	3
have	4
hit	1
that	4
comfortable	1
stage	1
...	3
you	4
know	3
,	5
not	4
quite	2
so	3
formal	1
about	3
dates	1
etc	2
.	5

In	3
one	3
sense	1
it	4
's	4
great	3
,	5
but	3
it	4
also	3
makes	2
things	2
a	5
lot	2
harder	0
to	5
read	2
.	5

Anyway	1
,	5
I	4
'm	3
sure	2
my	4
Mom	1
told	2
you	4
guys	2
but	3
Travis	1
and	5
Kathy	1
got	3
to	5
meet	2
him	3
and	5
I	4
think	3
it	4
went	2
well	3
.	5

Hopefully	0

if	3
we	3
're	2
still	3

come	2

you	4

I	4
just	3
have	4

Dear	1
Justin	1

Marly	0
asked	2
me	3
to	5
respond	1
to	5
you	4
.	5

As	2
you	4
know	3
,	5
the	5
suffix	0
ONLINE	0
is	4
purely	0
descriptive	0
and	5
now	3
used	2
by	3
many	3
companies	1
.	5

Therefore	1
,	5
any	3
trade	1
mark	1
registration	1
that	4
incorporates	0
the	5
word	2
ONLINE	0
as	4
a	5
suffix	0
in	4
the	5
way	3
that	4
you	4
use	3
it	4
will	4
not	4
enable	0
its	3
owner	2
to	5
prevent	1
others	2
from	4
using	2
the	5
word	2
ONLINE	0
.	5

Given	1
the	5
above	2
,	5
if	3
you	4
have	4
adequate	0
protection	1
for	4
the	5
word	2
ENRON	1
(	4
which	3
covers	0
the	5

line	2
as	4
well	3
as	4
your	4
core	1
activities	2
)	4
,	5
I	4
'd	2
say	3
that	4
another	2
application	1
for	4
the	5
words	1
ENRON	1
ONLINE	0
is	4
probably	2
unnecessary	0
.	5

However	2
,	5
if	3
you	4
use	3
a	5
particular	1
logo	0
for	4
the	5
on	4

line	2

,	5
that	4
should	3
be	4

If	3
Sam	1
's	4
description	0
below	2
of	5
the	5
GCP	1
procedure	1
is	4
correct	1
,	5
it	4
looks	2
to	5
me	3
like	3
something	2
needs	2
to	5
be	4
changed	1
.	5

The	4
difficulty	1
lies	1
in	4
the	5
fact	2
that	4
the	5
confirmation	0
system	2
reads	0
the	5
counterparty	1
's	4
name	2
from	4
Global	1
Counterparty	1
.	5

Since	1
divisions	1
of	5
companies	1
are	4
not	4
legal	2
entities	1
they	4
do	4
not	4
have	4
the	5
power	2
to	5
contract	2
in	4
their	3
own	2
names	1
.	5

If	3
the	5
correct	1
legal	2
name	2
is	4
not	4
in	4
Global	1
Counterparty	1
,	5
the	5
confirmation	0
goes	1
out	3
with	4
the	5
wrong	2
legal	2
name	2
on	4
it	4
seriously	1
compromising	0
the	5
contract	2
itself	2
.	5

That	2
is	4
the	5
source	1
of	5
Tana	1
's	4
concern	1
regarding	2
the	5
correct	1
entering	1
of	5
divisions	1
in	4
the	5
system	2
.	5

My	3
suggestion	1
is	4
that	4
Global	1
Counterparty	1
use	3
the	5
same	3
name	2
that	4
the	5
customer	2
has	3
signed	2
on	4
the	5
EnronOnline	1
Password	1
Application	1
--	3
my	4
understanding	1
is	4
that	4
the	5
EnronOnline	1
team	2
returns	0
inappropriate	0
Applications	0
to	5
the	5
customer	2
until	2
they	4
are	4
correctly	1
completed	1
.	5

In	3
this	4
particular	1
case	2
since	2
the	5
counterparty	1
is	4
still	3
not	4
allowed	1
to	5
transact	0
on	4
EnronOnline	1
almost	2
a	5
month	2
after	3
sending	1

their	3

they	4
are	4

are	4
now	3

It	3

Concern	0
:	3

Through	0

,	5
I	4
hear	2
constantly	1
about	3
identity	1
fraud	0
using	2
stolen	0
social	1

information	2
.	5

I	4
am	3
very	3
concerned	1
about	3
this	4
issue	2
.	5

I	4
have	4
the	5
following	2
suggestion	1
for	4
our	3
company	2
.	5

Since	1
Enron	2
's	4
employees	1
are	4
assigned	1
an	3
SAP	1
identification	0
numbers	1
(	4
P	0
number	2
)	4
and	5
an	3
HR	1
number	2
,	5
could	3
Enron	2
as	4
a	5
company	2
use	3
these	3
IDs	0
instead	2
of	5
the	5
SS	1
numbers	1
?	4

This	3
will	4
be	4
safer	1
for	4
all	3
employees	1
.	5

For	2
example	2
,	5
I	4
am	3
concerned	1
when	3
I	4
buy	2
the	5
monthly	1
bus	1
passes	0
and	5
I	4
have	4
to	5
fill	1
in	4
my	4
SS	1
number	2
.	5

I	4
do	4
not	4
feel	2
secure	1
at	4
all	3
to	5
see	3
my	4
SS	1
in	4
so	3
many	3
databases	0
at	4
Enron	2
,	5
especially	2
when	3
some	3
databases	0
are	4
from	4
third	1
-	4
parties	1
(	4
out	3
-	4
sourcing	0
)	4
.	5

We	3
could	3
use	3
our	3
badge	0
number	2
there	3
instead	2
of	5
our	3
SS	1
.	5

Please	3
let	2
me	3
know	3
how	3
your	4
organization	1
can	3
help	3
the	5
Enron	2
employees	1
feel	2
safer	1
about	3
the	5
safeguard	0
of	5
their	3
SS	1
number	2

following	2
up	3
on	4
our	3
discussion	1
yesterday	1
;	2
for	4
these	3
types	1
of	5
deals	1
,	5
i	3
do	4
nt	2
think	3
it	4
s	3
necessary	1
to	5
have	4
all	3
the	5
documentation	1
of	5
our	3
counterparty	1
's	4
authorization	0
to	5
enter	1
into	3
the	5
agreement	2
.	5

these	3
are	4
short	2
term	1
transactions	1
and	5
requiring	1
this	4
documentation	1
will	4
cause	1
us	3
to	5
lose	0
business	2
because	3
competitive	1
alternatives	1
do	4
not	4
have	4
such	2
burdensome	0
requirements	1
.	5

the	5
primary	1
reason	2
we	3
need	3
these	3
things	2
is	4
for	4
the	5
scenario	1
where	2
a	5
muni	0
does	3
a	5
derivative	0
deal	2
with	4
an	3
open	2
-	4
ended	1
downside	0
,	5
loses	0
$	3
50	2
million	2
,	5
and	5
then	3
claims	1
that	4
it	4
was	4
not	4
a	5
valid	0
contract	2
.	5

in	4
our	3
case	2
,	5
they	4
are	4
only	3
hedging	0
.	5

we	3
are	4
collecting	0
a	5
premium	1
up	3
front	2
and	5
their	3
total	1
cost	2
is	4
known	2
up	3
front	2
.	5

therefore	1
they	4
will	4
not	4
attempt	1
to	5
make	3
this	4
claim	1
.	5

even	3
if	3
they	4
did	3
,	5
our	3
risk	2
is	4
limited	1
to	5
the	5
premium	1
,	5
not	4
some	3
big	2
payout	0
.	5

the	5
risk	2
of	5
losing	1
business	2
is	4
far	2
greater	1
than	3
the	5
risk	2
of	5
a	5
counterparty	1
trying	2
to	5
get	3
their	3
premium	1
back	3
.	5

seems	2
like	3
a	5
5	2
second	2
decision	1
to	5
me	3
.	5

is	4
it	4
possible	2
to	5
combine	0
the	5
standard	1
isda	0
and	5
our	3

by	3
going	3

from	4

maybe	2
we	3
can	3
eliminate	0
these	3

Here	2
's	4
a	5
story	1
...	3
as	4
I	4
was	4
waiting	1
at	4
the	5
bus	1
stop	2
(	4
7:35	0
am	3
)	4
to	5
go	3
to	5
school	2
,	5
a	5
lady	1
approached	0
me	3
and	5
asked	2
if	3
I	4
'd	2
make	3
sure	2
her	3
daughter	1
got	3
on	4
a	5
certain	2
bus	1
.	5

The	4
mother	1
was	4
running	2
late	2
for	4
work	3
and	5
could	3
not	4
wait	2
.	5

I	4
could	3
n't	4
say	3
no	3
...	3
so	3
Nicki	0
(	4
the	5
little	2
girl	2
-	4
10	2
yrs.	0
old	2
)	4
and	5
I	4
waited	1
for	4
the	5
bus	1
.	5

It	3
was	4
now	3
,	5
8:15	0
and	5
there	3
was	4
no	3
sign	1
of	5
her	3
bus	1
.	5

On	2
top	2
of	5
things	2
,	5
I	4
had	3
quiz	0
at	4
8	2
am	3
.	5

Which	1
I	4
then	3
realized	1
I	4
missed	1
.	5

I	4
decided	1
that	4
Nicki	0
would	3
just	3
have	4
to	5
wait	2
on	4
her	3
own	2
.	5

I	4
asked	2
her	3
if	3
she	3
had	3
any	3
relatives	0
that	4
would	3
want	3
to	5
know	3
of	5
her	3
whereabouts	0

I	4
called	2
her	3

and	5
explained	1

her	3
.	5

Pretty	0

A	3

runs	0
through	2

arrived	1
and	5
I	4
almost	2
got	3
on	4
without	2
her	3
,	5
but	3
I	4
could	3
n't	4
do	4
it	4
.	5

Finally	1
,	5
I	4
told	2
the	5
little	2
girl	2
that	4
she	3
would	3
have	4
to	5
accompany	0
me	3
to	5
school	2
(	4
8:30	1
am	3
)	4
.	5

There	2
were	3
only	3
15	2
minutes	2
left	2
of	5
class	1
.	5

I	4
stayed	1
for	4
the	5
remainder	0
of	5
the	5
lecture	0

After	2
class	1
we	3
went	2
back	3
to	5
bus	1
stop	2
and	5
within	2
minutes	2
her	3
bus	1
arrived	1
.	5

I	4
told	2
the	5
bus	1
driver	1
where	2
to	5
drop	1
her	3
off	2
.	5

I	4
notified	1
her	3
grandmother	0
with	4
the	5
time	3
of	5
the	5
departure	0
.	5

And	2
I	4
was	4
relieved	0
when	3
Nicki	0

Hi	2
all	3

There	2
are	4
already	2
several	2
forums	0
around	2
the	5
net	1
focused	1
on	4
discussing	0
Guild	1
Wars	1
,	5
so	3
why	2
create	1
a	5
new	3
one	3
?	4

I	4
say	3
why	2
not	4
?	4

The	4
main	2
reason	2
is	4
Google	1
is	4
more	3
accessible	0
to	5
the	5
global	2
community	1
and	5
you	4
can	3
rest	2
assured	1
that	4
it	4
's	4
not	4
going	3
to	5
go	3
away	2
.	5

I	4
have	4
seen	2
great	3
fan	1
sites	1
suddenly	0
disappear	0
without	2
notice	1
and	5
for	4
no	3
reason	2
.	5

Usually	1
this	4
happens	1
because	3
the	5
developer	0
of	5
the	5
site	2
can	3
no	3
longer	2
afford	1
the	5
cost	2
of	5
bandwidth	0
being	3
used	2
.	5

That	2
said	3
,	5
the	5
maintenance	1
of	5
this	4
forum	0
is	4
handled	1
by	3
Google	1
and	5
thus	1
will	4
remain	1
reliable	1
and	5
it	4
will	4
ultimately	0
give	2
us	3
more	3
time	3
to	5
play	2
:)	2
.	5

I	4
'm	3
nothing	2
more	3
than	3
a	5
devoted	1
fan	1
of	5
the	5

myself	1

I	4
hope	2

The	4

is	4
very	3

go	3
ahead	1

get	3

there	3

the	5

STEP	1
ONE	1
:	3

Get	1
six	2

paper	1
and	5
write	1
the	5
following	2
on	4
each	2
piece	2

Now	2
get	3
6	2
U.S.	2
$	3
1.00	0

and	5
place	3
ONE	1
inside	2
of	5
EACH	0
of	5
the	5
six	2
pieces	1
of	5

so	3
the	5

not	4
be	4
seen	2
through	2
the	5

(	4
to	5
prevent	1
thievery	0
)	4
.	5

Next	1
,	5
place	3

each	2

the	5

seal	0

You	3

Is	2
there	3
any	3
cure	1
for	4
mouse	1
poison	1
?	4

I	4
found	2
a	5
poor	2
little	2
mouse	1
walking	1
around	2
in	4
my	4
friend	2
s	3
house	2
,	5
and	5
since	2
I	4
was	4
able	2
to	5
catch	1
it	4
very	3
easily	1
(	4
normally	1
mice	1
move	2
at	4
the	5
speed	1
of	5
light	2
)	4
,	5
and	5
since	2
it	4
was	4
acting	1
unresponsive	0
,	5
I	4
thought	2
it	4
was	4
infected	0
with	4
mouse	1
poison	1
,	5
since	2
my	4
friend	2
uses	1
it	4
.	5

I	4
know	3
that	4
the	5
mouse	1
will	4
probably	2
die	1
,	5
but	3
I	4
was	4
wondering	1
if	3
there	3
is	4
any	3
cure	1
for	4
mouse	1
poison	1
?	4

I	4
just	3
hate	1
to	5
see	3
the	5
poor	2
dears	0
experience	2
a	5
slow	1
painful	1
death	2
that	4
way	3
:(	1
.	5

Without	1
knowing	1
the	5
exact	1
poison	1
,	5
no	3
.	5

A	3
common	1
one	3
is	4
arsenic	0
and	5
there	3
really	3
is	4
n't	4
a	5
way	3
to	5
cure	1
that	4
.	5

Take	1
the	5
mouse	1
to	5
an	3
emergency	1
vet	2
and	5
have	4
them	3
use	3
CO2	0
to	5
put	2
the	5
mouse	1
to	5
sleep	1
.	5

Or	1
,	5
you	4
can	3
put	2
the	5
animal	1
in	4
a	5
snap	0
trap	0
designed	1
for	4
rats	1
or	4
mice	1
since	2
that	4
is	4
the	5
only	3
really	3
humane	0
kill	1
method	1

A	3

And	2
after	3
4	2

when	3
it	4

only	3

In	3
Vietnam	1

when	3
a	5

born	1

they	4

be	4
named	1

that	4
of	5
their	3
fathers	0

a	5

for	4

,	5
the	5

are	4
orphans	0

you	4

keeping	1
him	3
in	4
there	3

be	4
kept	2
away	2
from	4
other	3
pets	1

then	3
I	4
can	3
understand	2
why	2
you	4
would	3
choose	1
to	5
keep	2
him	3
there	3
.	5

There	2
are	4
some	3
things	2
to	5
consider	1
though	2
...	3

Rodents	0
require	1
special	2
bedding	1
in	4
their	3
cages	1
to	5
absorb	0
their	3
waste	1
,	5
and	5
this	4
needs	2
to	5
be	4
cleaned	1
regularly	1
,	5
or	4
your	4
hamster	1
could	3
suffer	1
from	4
problems	2
due	2
the	5
buildup	0
of	5
ammonia	0
from	4
his	3
urine	1
.	5

When	2
you	4
take	3
a	5
warm	1
shower	1
and	5
build	1
up	3
steam	0
,	5
his	3
cage	2
will	4
collect	0
water	2
,	5
the	5
bedding	1
will	4
absorb	0
much	3
of	5
it	4
,	5
and	5
will	4
not	4
be	4
able	2
to	5
absorb	0
the	5
urine	1
quite	2
as	4
it	4
should	3
.	5

You	3
will	4
also	3
have	4
to	5
be	4
wary	0
of	5
mold	0
forming	0
on	4
any	3
toys	1
or	4
hide	1
-	4
aways	0
he	4
may	3
have	4
.	5

You	3
also	3
do	4
n't	4
want	3
it	4
getting	2
too	2
warm	1
for	4
him	3
too	2
often	2
.	5

Overall	1
,	5
it	4
is	4
not	4
a	5
good	3
solution	1
,	5
but	3
you	4
can	3
keep	2
him	3
healthy	1
and	5
pull	1
it	4
off	2
if	3
you	4
take	3
the	5
time	3
to	5
give	2
him	3
the	5
extra	1
care	2
he	4
will	4
need	3
because	3
of	5
it	4
.	5

It	3
may	3
be	4
a	5
problem	2
because	3
the	5
temperature	1
is	4
constantly	1
changing	1
.	5

I	4
would	3
personally	1
put	2
him	3
somewhere	1
else	2

Is	2
Fujairah	1
a	5
nice	2
place	3

live	2
in	4
?	4

My	3
family	2

I	4
are	4
planning	2
to	5
shift	0
to	5
Fujairah	1
in	4
a	5
couple	2
of	5
years	3
.	5

So	2
I	4
just	3
needed	2
to	5
know	3
if	3
it	4
is	4
a	5
suitable	0
place	3
to	5
live	2
in	4
and	5
in	4
what	3
ways	1
.	5

Also	2
that	4
,	5
I	4
heard	2
in	4
the	5
next	2
few	2

Fujairah	1
would	3
be	4
as	4
good	3
as	4
Dubai	1

is	4
it	4
true	1

I	4
'd	2
be	4
happy	2
if	3
someone	2

someone	2
who	3
has	3

...	3
I	4
ve	1
been	3
living	2
in	4
Fujairah	1
my	4
entire	2

and	5
I	4
must	2
say	3
that	4
it	4
is	4
developing	1
in	4
a	5
good	3
way	3
.	5

I	4
think	3
2012	1
is	4
going	3
to	5
be	4
a	5
great	3
year	3
for	4
Fujairah	1
as	4
we	3
have	4

Things	0
to	5
do	4
in	4
Fujairah	1

It	3
s	3
between	2
sea	1

so	3
you	4
can	3
camp	0
on	4

...	3
Fishing	0

And	2
now	3
they	4
are	4
finishing	0
a	5
road	1
between	2
Fujairah	1
and	5
Dubai	1
in	4
45	1
minutes	2
only	3
!	3

So	2
,	5
no	3
it	4
is	4
not	4
as	4
good	3
as	4
Dubai	1
,	5
but	3
it	4
s	3

you	4

it	4

nothing	2

for	4

yes	2
the	5

these	3

can	3
feel	2
them	3

the	5
do	4
n't	4
do	4
any	3
damage	1

Since	1
lots	2
of	5
people	3
are	4
still	3
living	2
there	3

then	3
it	4
must	2
be	4
fine	2
to	5
visit	2

However	2
the	5
CBD	0

closed	1

a	5

it	4

stuff	1

has	3
n't	4

I	4
'm	3
sure	2
that	4
you	4
can	3
find	2
some	3

that	4
are	4
running	2

if	3

there	3

just	3

's	4
on	4
the	5
small	2

for	4
a	5

if	3
this	4

true	1
in	4
her	3

she	3

I	4
'm	3
unsure	0
of	5
this	4

because	3
once	2
I	4
watched	1
a	5

my	4

she	3
did	3
n't	4

to	5
seeing	1
another	2

I	4
heard	2
that	4
a	5
company	2
(	4
here	3
is	4
a	5
link	1

high	2

that	4

n't	4
hear	2

As	2
far	2
as	4
I	4
understand	2
,	5
this	4
ad	0
will	4
get	3
dogs	1
excited	1
,	5
but	3
my	4
question	2
is	4
:	3
Can	2
dogs	1
actually	2
see	3
the	5
images	1
featured	0
in	4
the	5
advert	0
like	3
humans	1
?	4

Also	2
,	5
can	3
animals	2
remember	2
images	1
on	4
TV	1
like	3
us	3
,	5
humans	1
?	4

If	3
so	3
,	5
then	3
does	3
that	4
mean	2
that	4
if	3
you	4
watched	1
a	5
scary	1
movie	0
and	5
your	4
dog	2
/	3
cat	2
/	3
parrot	0
was	4
in	4
the	5
same	3
room	2
as	4
you	4
they	4
will	4
also	3
get	3
scared	1
?	4

I	4
would	3
n't	4
know	3
--	3
I	4
do	4
n't	4
particularly	1
like	3
scary	1
movies	1
,	5
and	5
I	4
have	4
n't	4
tried	2
this	4
with	4
my	4
pet	2
.	5

Although	1
,	5
I	4
do	4
n't	4
think	3
that	4
scary	1
movies	1
will	4
affect	0
pets	1
for	4
a	5
long	2
time	3
;	2
I	4
am	3
sure	2
they	4
'll	3
forget	1
sometime	1
--	3
or	4
am	3
I	4
wrong	2
?	4

So	2
what	3
about	3
T.V.	1
?	4

Do	2
dogs	1
enjoy	1
watching	1
T.V.	1
?	4

Well	2
,	5
T.V.	1
is	4
a	5
series	1
of	5
flickering	0
pictures	1
that	4
are	4
streamed	0
together	2
to	5
make	3
a	5
moving	2
picture	1
.	5

The	4
pictures	1
are	4
broadcast	0
at	4
a	5
rate	2
of	5
about	3
60	1
Hz	0
,	5
which	3
is	4
how	3
fast	1
they	4
need	3
to	5
move	2
for	4
us	3
to	5
see	3
them	3
as	4
a	5
moving	2
,	5
flawless	0
picture	1
.	5

To	2
a	5
dog	2
,	5
watching	1
T.V.	1
is	4
a	5
lot	2
like	3
watching	1
and	5
old	2
scratchy	0
silent	0
film	1
because	3
their	3
flicker	0
fusion	0
seems	2
to	5
occur	1
at	4
a	5
rate	2
of	5
70	1
to	5
80	1
Hz	0
.	5

So	2
they	4
see	3
the	5
pictures	1
flicker	0
slower	0
and	5
there	3
for	4
it	4
seems	2
choppy	0
to	5
them	3
.	5

So	2
chances	1
are	4
that	4
if	3
your	4
dog	2
likes	1
to	5
watch	1
T.V.	1
,	5
it	4
's	4
probably	2
because	3
of	5
the	5
sounds	1
.	5

Hearing	0
is	4
a	5
dog	2
's	4
secondary	0
sense	1
,	5
and	5
I	4
will	4
discuss	2
that	4
in	4
another	2
blog	1
entery	0
.	5

Yes	2
they	4
do	4
.	5

i	3
m	2
pretty	2
sure	2
that	4
they	4
do	4
see	3
things	2
on	4
the	5
tv	1
screen	1
because	3
my	4
cat	2
chases	0
things	2
around	2
the	5
tv	1
screen	1

How	2
much	3
should	3
I	4
be	4
looking	2
at	4
for	4
horse	2
transportation	1
?	4

I	4
need	3
one	3
horse	2
transported	1
to	5
shows	1
throughout	1
the	5
2012	1
show	2
season	1
,	5
and	5
the	5
location	1
is	4
about	3
3	3
hours	2
away	2
from	4
where	2
I	4
live	2
.	5

The	4
place	3
where	2
I	4
'm	3
boarding	1
is	4
not	4
likely	2
to	5
want	3
to	5
take	3
me	3
this	4
far	2
,	5
and	5
I	4
do	4
not	4
have	4
any	3
ways	1
of	5
hauling	0
him	3
myself	1
.	5

So	2
I	4
want	3
to	5
hire	1
someone	2
(	4
or	4
multiple	1
people	3
)	4
to	5
transport	1
me	3
to	5
these	3
shows	1
.	5

If	3
they	4
ask	2
how	3
much	3
I	4
'm	3
willing	2
to	5
pay	2
,	5
what	3
is	4
a	5
good	3
price	2
range	1
?	4

I	4
saw	2
a	5
site	2
that	4
charges	1
$	3
0.70	0
per	2
mile	1
.	5

Is	2
that	4
reasonable	2
?	4

Impossible	0
to	5
say	3
,	5
but	3
I	4
guess	2
you	4
would	3
have	4
to	5
work	3
out	3
fuel	1
consumption	0
for	4
the	5
particular	1
vehicle	1
that	4
they	4
are	4
using	2
and	5
pay	2
a	5
proportion	0

that	4
,	5
and	5
some	3
on	4
top	2
for	4
the	5
driver	1
's	4
time	3
and	5
effort	1
,	5
unless	2
you	4
are	4
able	2
to	5
share	1
transport	1
with	4
another	2
or	4
more	3
,	5
that	4
would	3
keep	2
the	5
costs	1
down	2

Remember	1
that	4
you	4
get	3
what	3
you	4

for	4

they	4

EDIT	0
:	3
My	3
memory	1
may	3

so	3
you	4

get	3
a	5
more	3
accurate	1
answer	2
from	4
someone	2
else	2
who	3
remembers	0
the	5
time	3
.	5

Can	2
rabbits	1
and	5
chickens	1
live	2
together	2
?	4

I	4
am	3
thinking	1
about	3
getting	2
a	5
rabbit	1
as	4
a	5
pet	2
,	5
but	3
my	4
parents	2
said	3
that	4
it	4
has	3
to	5
stay	2
outside	2
.	5

We	3
also	3
own	2
two	3
chickens	1
that	4
are	4
kept	2
in	4
a	5
run	2
behind	2
out	3
garage	1
/	3
barn	1
thing	2
.	5

There	2
is	4
already	2
a	5
little	2
dog	2
house	2
that	4
I	4
would	3
turn	1
into	3
a	5
little	2
rabbit	1
hutch	0
being	3
kept	2
back	3
there	3
and	5
I	4
was	4
thinking	1
about	3
keeping	1
the	5
rabbit	1
in	4
the	5
run	2
with	4
the	5
chickens	1
,	5
but	3
keeping	1
the	5
chickens	1
in	4
the	5
coop	0
and	5
the	5
rabbit	1
in	4
the	5
hutch	0
at	4
night	2
.	5

However	2
,	5
in	4
the	5
day	3
time	3
would	3
it	4
be	4
okay	1
for	4
the	5
rabbit	1
to	5
hop	0
around	2
along	2
with	4
the	5
chickens	1
?	4

We	3
feed	2
the	5
chickens	1
scraps	0
of	5
veggies	0
and	5
fruits	0
throughout	1
the	5
day	3
,	5
but	3
it	4
's	4
nothing	2
that	4
a	5
rabbit	1
would	3
n't	4
be	4
able	2
to	5
digest	0
just	3
fine	2
.	5

So	2
,	5
can	3
rabbits	1
and	5
chickens	1
live	2
together	2
as	4
long	2
as	4
they	4
have	4
separate	1
places	2
for	4
their	3
food	3
and	5
water	2
?	4

(	4
The	4
rabbit	1
hutch	0
would	3
have	4
an	3
opening	1
only	3
big	2
enough	2
for	4
the	5
rabbit	1
,	5
the	5
chickens	1
would	3
not	4
be	4
able	2
to	5
get	3
to	5
the	5
rabbit	1
food	3
)	4
Also	2
,	5
is	4
it	4
okay	1
if	3
the	5
rabbit	1
occasionally	0
sneaks	0
a	5
few	2
bites	0
of	5
chicken	1
feed	2
?	4

My	3
last	2
rabbit	1
did	3
that	4
a	5
few	2
times	2
,	5
and	5
he	4
was	4
fine	2
...	3

I	4
just	3
wan	1
na	1
make	3
sure	2
:)	2
Thank	2
!	3

Yes	2
,	5
but	3
be	4
sure	2
that	4
your	4
chickens	1
are	4
all	3
hens	0
(	4
I	4
mean	2
not	4
roosters	0
)	4
,	5
Roosters	0
may	3
attack	2
rabbits	1
or	4
anything	2
they	4
see	3
moving	2
,	5
so	3
be	4
aware	1
of	5
that	4
,	5
hens	0
are	4
friendly	2
with	4
almost	2
all	3
kinds	1
of	5
pets	1
!	3

From	2
my	4
experience	2
Hens	0
(	4
Not	2
roosters	0
)	4
are	4
very	3
friendly	2
with	4
duck	0
,	5
Guinea	1
pigs	0
,	5
kittens	1
,	5
cows	0
,	5
Rabbits	0
,	5
etc	2
.	5

Be	1
sure	2
not	4
to	5
feed	2
your	4
rabbits	1
non-veg	0
items	1
!	3

You	3
said	3
they	4
live	2
in	4
different	2
cages	1
and	5
they	4
are	4
free	2
in	4
day	3
,	5
so	3
no	3
problem	2
,	5
do	4
n't	4
put	2
both	2
of	5
them	3
in	4
one	3
cage	2
because	3
rabbits	1
bedding	1
is	4
different	2
than	3
that	4
of	5
hens	0
,	5
wet	1
bedding	1
can	3
cause	1
diseases	0
in	4
them	3
!	3

So	2
,	5
do	4
n't	4
put	2
both	2
of	5
them	3
in	4
one	3
cage	2
.	5

Good	2
luck	1
!	3

yea	0
i	3
guess	2
but	3
rabbits	1
a	5
easily	1
escape	1
a	5
pen	0
or	4
another	2
rabbit	1
could	3
get	3
in	4
there	3
and	5
that	4
rabbit	1
could	3
be	4
the	5
opposite	0
gender	1
.	5

So	2
be	4
very	3
careful	0
and	5
some	3
feeds	0
could	3
be	4
toxic	1
to	5
rabbits	1
and	5
safe	1
for	4
chickens	1
.	5

Rabbits	0
do	4
burrow	0
also	3
so	3
do	4
n't	4
be	4
surprised	1
if	3
chicken	1
are	4
falling	0
into	3
holes	0
.	5

rabbits	1
are	4
delicate	0
and	5
can	3
get	3
diseases	0
so	3
watch	1
out	3
for	4
that	4

they	4
all	3

'll	3

Molten	0
brass	1

usually	2
it	4

Even	2
if	3

it	4

you	4

which	3

a	5

a	5

a	5

a	5
hamster	1

a	5
guinea	0

and	5
why	2
is	4
the	5
one	3
a	5
better	2
pet	2

Get	1
a	5
guinea	0
pig	0

I	4
have	4
a	5
hamster	1
,	5
and	5
mice	1
and	5
rats	1
like	3
to	5
escape	1
.	5

The	4
Guinea	1
pig	0
is	4
better	2
because	3
it	4
s	3
a	5
lot	2
larger	1
than	3
a	5
hamster	1

rat	1

So	2
if	3

him	3

he	4

because	3
smaller	1
rodents	0
just	3
LOVE	1

Depends	0

what	3
you	4
want	3
in	4
a	5
pet	2

to	5
be	4
honest	1

Also	2
depends	1
on	4
the	5
space	2
you	4
have	4

how	3

you	4
can	3
handle	1
the	5
pet	2

I	4
've	3
had	3
experience	2
with	4
all	3
of	5
those	2
pets	1
except	1
Degus	0
.	5

My	3
favorite	1
would	3
have	4
to	5
be	4
the	5
rat	1

They	3
're	2
incredibly	1
social	1

highly	2

and	5
very	3
clean	2

Mine	0
learned	1
to	5
"	4
go	3
to	5
the	5
bathroom	1
"	4
only	3
in	4
their	3
cages	1

loved	1
to	5
ride	1
on	4
my	4
shoulder	1
or	4
hang	1
out	3
in	4
my	4
hoodie	0
pouch	0

The	4
only	3
downside	0
is	4
they	4
should	3
be	4
kept	2
in	4
pairs	0
or	4
trios	0
and	5
require	1
a	5
pretty	2
large	2
habitat	1

That	2
means	2
expense	1
,	5
space	2
,	5
and	5
they	4
require	1
weekly	1

My	3

the	5
Guinea	1

more	3

too	2

need	3
weekly	1
cage	2

can	3
cost	2
quite	2
a	5
bit	2

I	4
could	3

my	4
mice	1

they	4
where	2

How	2
do	4
you	4
make	3

a	5

surrounded	1
by	3

the	5

We	3

the	5
cat	2
for	4
10	2

do	4
nt	2
want	3
to	5

How	2
could	3
we	3
make	3
it	4
settle	1
in	4
a	5
new	3
house	2

you	4
are	4
not	4
just	3
moving	2
house	2
-	4
your	4
cat	2
is	4
losing	1
his	3
territory	1

territory	1
is	4
very	3
important	2
to	5
cats	2

and	5
they	4
are	4
very	3
nervous	1
when	3
they	4
go	3
into	3
a	5
new	3
place	3
-	4
a	5
new	3
house	2
could	3
be	4
full	2
of	5
predators	1
,	5
or	4
unknown	1
menaces	0
-	4
well	3
at	4
least	2
he	4
thinks	1
so	3
.	5

you	4
will	4
need	3
to	5
give	2
him	3
only	3
a	5
small	2
place	3

explore	1

so	3
he	4
can	3
make	3
it	4
his	3
territory	1

and	5
feel	2
safe	1
there	3

then	3

he	4

retreat	0
to	5
when	3
he	4
feels	1

put	2
him	3

the	5

is	4
best	3
(	4
seeing	1
you	4
so	3

but	3
others	2
will	4
work	3
just	3

close	2
the	5
door	2

and	5
keep	2
him	3
in	4
there	3
for	4
a	5
week	2

he	4
will	4
feel	2
much	3
safer	1
in	4
that	4
one	3
room	2

than	3
in	4
a	5
huge	1
unknown	1
house	2

he	4
will	4
explore	1
the	5

mark	1
everything	2

and	5
try	2
to	5
make	3
it	4

he	4
will	4
reassure	0
himself	1

and	5
that	4
no	3

he	4

when	3
he	4

made	3
it	4

and	5
will	4
be	4
getting	2
more	3

let	2
him	3

then	3
put	2

so	3
going	3
back	3

will	4
make	3
him	3
much	3
happier	1

extend	1
the	5

out	3
each	2

for	4
the	5
first	3

always	2
put	2
him	3
in	4
his	3
room	2
at	4
night	2

so	3
he	4

soon	2

Put	1
the	5

just	3
walk	2

take	3
the	5

a	5
"	4

The	4
difference	1

the	5

they	4

The	4

I	4
posted	1

so	3
I	4
've	3

Well	2
,	5
I	4
'll	3
try	2
to	5
make	3
this	4
short	2
.	5

I	4
have	4
known	2
this	4
guy	2
for	4
a	5
long	2
time	3
,	5
but	3
we	3
've	3
never	3
been	3
good	3
friends	2
or	4
anything	2
.	5

He	3
is	4
my	4
farrier	1
(	4
shoes	0
my	4
horse	2
s	3
feet	1
)	4
so	3
I	4
am	3
technically	0
a	5
client	1
if	3
you	4
want	3
to	5
view	1
it	4
that	4
way	3
.	5

Well	2
,	5
almost	2
two	3
weeks	2
ago	2
he	4
came	2
out	3
and	5
did	3
my	4
horse	2
s	3
feet	1
and	5
was	4
SO	1
flirty	0
.	5

He	3
always	2
hugs	0
me	3
when	3
he	4
comes	2
,	5
but	3
he	4
gave	2
me	3
at	4
least	2
5	2
tight	1
,	5
long	2
,	5
back	3
rubbing	0
hugs	0
while	2
he	4
was	4
there	3

We	3
were	3
also	3
just	3
talking	2
about	3
my	4
horse	2
's	4
crappy	0
feet	1
and	5
he	4
mentioned	2
.	5

"	4
Well	2
,	5
if	3
you	4
ever	2
just	3
want	3
to	5
see	3
me	3
I	4
'll	3
come	2
out	3
and	5
look	2
him	3
over	3
and	5
then	3
we	3
can	3
grab	1
a	5
coffee	1
after	3
.	5
"	4

That	2
has	3
NEVER	1
happened	1
before	3
so	3
I	4
was	4
kinda	0
realizing	0
at	4
that	4
point	2
that	4
he	4
was	4
a	5
little	2
interested	2
.	5

Right	1
??	1

Anyway	1
,	5
so	3
he	4
ended	1
up	3
leaving	1
one	3
nail	1
out	3
of	5
my	4
horse	2
s	3
foot	1
(	4
I	4
've	3
never	3
heard	2
of	5
a	5
farrier	1
doing	2
this	4
)	4
and	5
telling	1
me	3
to	5
call	3
him	3
in	4
a	5
few	2
days	2
(	4
first	3
it	4
was	4
a	5
week	2
,	5
then	3
it	4
was	4
a	5
few	2
days	2
lol	1
)	4
and	5
he	4
'd	2
come	2
back	3
out	3
and	5
put	2
it	4
in	4
.	5

He	3
told	2
me	3
to	5
remember	2
to	5
call	3
like	3
3	3
times	2
before	3
he	4
left	2
.	5

So	2
,	5
I	4
waited	1
a	5
week	2
to	5
call	3
because	3
I	4
was	4
busy	1
and	5
I	4
wanted	2
to	5
have	4
him	3
come	2
out	3
on	4
a	5
day	3
when	3
I	4
am	3
more	3
available	2
in	4
case	2
we	3
were	3
to	5
hang	1
out	3
after	3
;)	0

Anyway	1
,	5
so	3
that	4
was	4
2	3
days	2
ago	2
that	4
I	4
called	2
and	5
left	2
a	5
message	2
,	5
but	3
he	4
still	3
has	3
n't	4
called	2
back	3
yet	2
.	5

I	4
do	4
n't	4
know	3
if	3
I	4
should	3
call	3
him	3
again	2
tomorrow	2
or	4
not	4
?	4

I	4
know	3
a	5
lot	2
of	5
people	3
say	3
to	5
wait	2
until	2
he	4
calls	1
you	4
,	5
but	3
it	4
's	4
different	2
because	3
I	4
'm	3
a	5
client	1
and	5
technically	0
that	4
's	4
all	3
I	4
am	3
at	4
this	4
point	2
.	5

On	2
the	5
other	3
hand	2
though	2
,	5
if	3
I	4
'm	3
a	5
client	1
he	4
should	3
really	3
of	5
called	2
back	3
by	3
now	3
because	3
you	4
do	4
n't	4
leave	2
a	5
customer	2
hanging	1
.	5

He	3
did	3
n't	4
have	4
my	4
number	2
either	2
because	3
this	4
was	4
the	5
first	3
time	3
I	4
've	3
called	2
HIM	0
instead	2
of	5
his	3
dad	1
.	5

It	3
's	4
a	5
father	1
and	5
son	1
business	2
.	5

Anyway	1
,	5
I	4
would	3
appreciate	1
ANY	0

this	4

all	3

you	4

Ok	1
,	5
well	3
as	4
far	2
as	4
him	3
being	3
a	5
bad	2
farrier	1
for	4
leaving	1
a	5
nail	1
out	3
-	4
That	2
is	4
not	4

case	2
,	5
they	4
are	4
extremely	2
well	3
known	2
farriers	0
in	4
the	5
area	2

I	4
would	3
be	4
a	5
lot	2

concerned	1

the	5
shoe	1
fell	0
off	2

it	4
was	4

in	4
was	4
because	3
he	4
"	4
did	3
n't	4
want	3
to	5
risk	2
it	4
"	4
with	4
my	4
horse	2
's	4
horrible	1
feet	1
.	5

This	3
is	4
about	3
the	5
fourth	0
time	3
they	4
've	3
done	2
my	4
horse	2
's	4
feet	1
because	3
I	4
just	3
switched	0
back	3
to	5
them	3
.	5

The	4
only	3
reason	2
I	4
switched	0
away	2
from	4
them	3
in	4
the	5
first	3
place	3
is	4
because	3
my	4
good	3
friend	2
who	3
apprenticed	0
with	4
them	3
was	4
starting	1
out	3
on	4
his	3
own	2
.	5

However	2
,	5
he	4
left	2
my	4
horse	2
without	2
a	5
shoe	1
for	4
TWO	0
WEEKS	0
(	4
now	3
that	4
's	4
what	3
I	4
call	3
a	5
crap	1
farrier	1
)	4
.	5

Which	1
,	5
I	4
might	2
add	2
is	4
the	5
same	3
foot	1
that	4
keeps	1
crumbling	0
with	4
the	5
nails	1
.	5

So	2
,	5
obviously	1
I	4
switched	0
back	3
to	5
these	3
guys	2
.	5

Ok	1
,	5
calm	1
down	2
,	5
it	4
's	4
not	4
like	3
he	4
's	4
some	3
stranger	0
that	4
came	2
up	3
and	5
groped	0
me	3
lol	1
.	5

I	4
've	3
known	2
the	5
guy	2
for	4
about	3
10	2
years	3

I	4
am	3

few	2
years	3
older	1
than	3
me	3

And	2
yes	2
,	5
I	4

To	2
answer	2
Barry	0
White	1
,	5
yes	2
that	4
did	3
occur	1
to	5
me	3
:)	2
I	4
hope	2
that	4
is	4
all	3
he	4
's	4
waiting	1
for	4
.	5

On	2
the	5
other	3
hand	2
,	5
he	4
could	3
very	3
easily	1
just	3
call	3
me	3
and	5
say	3

I	4
'm	3
busy	1

now	3
,	5
I	4

I	4
have	4
no	3
idea	2

I	4
've	3
never	3

that	4
before	3

either	2

I	4
have	4
the	5
opportunity	1
to	5
pick	1
up	3
a	5
super	1
nice	2
6	2
year	3
old	2
for	4
free	2
.	5

He	3
's	4
not	4
lame	0
,	5
but	3
he	4
's	4
been	3
having	2
issues	2
.	5

Here	2
's	4
what	3
the	5
owner	2
has	3
said	3
:	3

I	4
have	4
a	5
5	2
year	3
old	2
that	4
lost	1
all	3
of	5
his	3
cheek	1
muscle	1
on	4
the	5
right	2
side	2
about	3
3	3
-	4
4	2
months	2
ago	2
.	5

I	4
chalked	0
it	4
up	3
to	5
possible	2
nerve	0
damage	1
,	5
because	3
this	4
is	4
what	3
the	5
vet	2
thought	2
and	5
the	5
other	3
cheek	1
muscle	1
was	4
fine	2
and	5
he	4
had	3
no	3
theeth	0
problems	2
.	5

So	2
I	4
sent	2
him	3
to	5
the	5
trainers	0
the	5
first	3
of	5
September	2
to	5
be	4
started	2
on	4
the	5
barrels	1
.	5

I	4
got	3
him	3
back	3
the	5
first	3
of	5
the	5
month	2
and	5
he	4
had	3
lost	1
some	3
weight	1
but	3
attributed	0
that	4
to	5
be	4
worked	2
everyday	0
(	4
I	4
expected	1
him	3
to	5
drop	1
some	3
)	4
.	5

He	3
is	4
now	3
losing	1
the	5
cheek	1
muscle	1
on	4
the	5
left	2
side	2
of	5
his	3
face	2
and	5
seems	2
to	5
be	4
dropping	0
weight	1
by	3
the	5
day	3
.	5

Had	1
him	3
to	5
a	5
dentist	1
yesterday	1
and	5
there	3
is	4
no	3
teeth	1
problems	2
.	5

He	3
can	3
eat	2
all	3
his	3
feed	2
and	5
does	3
n't	4
drop	1
any	3
,	5
but	3
can	3
not	4
eat	2
hay	0
from	4
lack	1
of	5
muscle	1
to	5
chew	0
it	4
.	5

He	3
is	4
gant	0
looking	2
in	4
his	3
flank	0
area	2
and	5
is	4
losing	1
topline	0
muscle	1
.	5

The	4
only	3
neurological	0
sign	1
that	4
he	4
shows	1
is	4
that	4
he	4
barely	1
drags	0
his	3
toes	1
and	5
sometimes	1
has	3
trouble	1
with	4
his	3
right	2
lead	1
.	5

The	4
horse	2
I	4
had	3
posted	1
about	3
a	5
couple	2
weeks	2
ago	2
with	4
the	5
atrophied	0
cheek	1
muscles	1
is	4
down	2
to	5
his	3
last	2
resort	0
for	4
life	2
.	5

I	4
CAN	0
NOT	2
afford	1
to	5
treat	1
whatever	1
is	4
wrong	2
with	4
him	3
.	5

NO	1
,	5
I	4
have	4
not	4
done	2
an	3
EPM	1
test	2
but	3
have	4
done	2
an	3
extensive	0
blood	1
panel	1
and	5
my	4
vet	2
did	3
a	5
neurological	0
physical	1
exam	1
.	5

We	3
elected	1
to	5
not	4
do	4
the	5
EPM	1
test	2
because	3
there	3
was	4
NO	1
neurological	0
signs	1
.	5

He	3
is	4
still	3
showing	1
no	3
signs	1
other	3
than	3
the	5
weight	1
loss	1
,	5
and	5
some	3
muscle	1
atrophy	0
.	5

He	3
eats	0
all	3
of	5
his	3
grain	0
but	3
it	4
just	3
takes	1
him	3
a	5
while	2
to	5
get	3
it	4
chewed	0
because	3
of	5
the	5
lack	1
of	5
muscle	1
in	4
his	3
jaws	0
.	5

So	2
I	4
might	2
get	3
the	5
horse	2
and	5
see	3
what	3
I	4
can	3
do	4
.	5

I	4
will	4
be	4
getting	2
with	4
my	4
vet	2
first	3
and	5
if	3
I	4
do	4
get	3
him	3
,	5
have	4
the	5
spinal	0
fluid	0
test	2
done	2
for	4
EPM	1
and	5
a	5
titer	0
test	2
.	5

Will	1
be	4
getting	2
a	5
copy	2
of	5
the	5
blood	1
results	1
the	5
owner	2
has	3
already	2
ran	1
as	4
well	3
.	5

My	3
other	3
theory	1
would	3
be	4
wobblers	0
.	5

I	4
'll	3
be	4
having	2
my	4
equine	0
chiro	1
/	3
acupuncturist	0
out	3
to	5
do	4
some	3
work	3
as	4
well	3
if	3
I	4
do	4
get	3
him	3
....	2

So	2
any	3
ideas	1

Think	0
I	4
should	3
do	4
it	4

Arby	0

Horse	0

I	4
'm	3

the	5
$	3
$	3

have	4
to	5
put	2
him	3
down	2

a	5
pretty	2

He	3
's	4
still	3

not	4

This	3
is	4
a	5
horse	2
that	4
I	4
otherwise	1
would	3
n't	4
be	4
able	2
to	5
afford	1
and	5
even	3
if	3
I	4
spend	1

treatment	1
I	4
come	2
out	3
ahead	1

I	4
posted	1
what	3
the	5
owner	2
as	4
said	3
in	4
paragraph	0
2	3

3	3

that	4
is	4

She	2
is	4
the	5
one	3
that	4
ca	2
n't	4
afford	1

do	4
anything	2
else	2
for	4
him	3
in	4
case	2
he	4
does	3
n't	4
recover	0

He	3
can	3

you	4

after	3

you	4
have	4

Is	2
that	4

it	4

I	4

you	4

up	3

It	3

bring	2

then	3
have	4

some	3

worth	2

If	3

first	3

only	3
an	3

We	3
hauled	0
the	5
horse	2

got	3
him	3

there	3

That	2
horse	2
returned	1
to	5

and	5
we	3
did	3
n't	4
notice	1

We	3
've	3
had	3
a	5

but	3
none	1
since	2
our	3
race	1

I	4
have	4
no	3
idea	2
if	3
that	4

or	4
farmers	0
are	4
doing	2
a	5

n't	4
had	3
an	3
EPM	1
horse	2
in	4
at	4

10	2
years	3

I	4
can	3
say	3
all	3
of	5
our	3
EPM	1
horses	1
were	3
treated	1
early	2
when	3
they	4
were	3
showing	1

all	3

We	3
've	3
always	2

The	4
only	3
difference	1
we	3

that	4

seemed	1
to	5
do	4
worse	1
on	4
the	5

It	3
might	2
just	3
be	4

or	4
the	5
fact	2
those	2
great	3

get	3
this	4

it	4

honestly	1
I	4
do	4

think	3
I	4

in	4
a	5

right	2
now	3
these	3
issues	2

Personally	0
I	4
think	3
you	4
should	3
just	3
keep	2
on	4
walking	1
by	3
.	5

You	3
should	3
have	4
you	4
chiro	1
out	3
before	3
you	4
decide	1
if	3
you	4
want	3
this	4
horse	2
or	4
not	4

If	3
you	4
have	4
a	5
good	3
repoire	0
(	4
which	3
I	4
'm	3
sure	2
you	4
do	4

with	4
them	3

they	4
should	3
be	4
honest	1
on	4
if	3
this	4
horse	2
is	4
fixable	0
to	5
any	3
degree	1
...	3
not	4
really	3
sure	2
what	3
you	4
want	3
to	5
do	4
with	4
him	3
...	3

Even	2
if	3
you	4
can	3
figure	1
out	3
what	3
is	4
wrong	2
with	4
this	4
poor	2
poneh	0
,	5
there	3
is	4
always	2
the	5
chance	2
for	4
remission	0

then	3
relapse	0

you	4
may	3

again	2

So	2
all	3
in	4
all	3

put	2
the	5
money	2
up	3

this	4

looked	1

They	3
were	3
very	3
patient	1

helpful	2
from	4
showing	1
the	5

the	5
paperwork	1

The	4
paperwork	1
was	4
a	5
very	3
easy	2

smooth	1

They	3
tried	2
to	5
run	2

I	4
purchased	1
a	5
2	3
-	4
year	3
old	2
certified	0
pre-owned	0
BMW	0
from	4
this	4
dealership	1
.	5

The	4
night	2
I	4
drove	1
back	3
home	2
,	5
I	4
found	2
that	4
the	5
rear	1
window	1
has	3
some	3
leakage	0
.	5

(	4
You	3
can	3
hear	2
the	5
wind	0
while	2
driving	1
on	4
highway	0
.	5

Very	1
likely	2
it	4
needs	2
a	5
new	3
window	1
seal	0
)	4
.	5

I	4
admit	0
that	4
I	4
should	3
have	4
paid	2
attention	1
to	5
this	4
kind	2
of	5
little	2
things	2
while	2
test	2
drive	1
.	5

(	4
But	2
this	4
is	4
a	5
certified	0
car	2
from	4
a	5
dealer	1
.	5
)	4

So	2
I	4
brought	1
the	5
car	2
back	3
the	5
second	2
day	3
.	5

They	3
told	2
me	3
that	4
this	4
is	4
not	4
under	2
warranty	0
and	5
want	3
to	5
charge	2
me	3
$	3
175	0
just	3
to	5

the	5

Who	1
knows	1
how	3
much	3
they	4
want	3
me	3

pay	2
to	5
fix	1
this	4

I	4
walked	1
away	2

my	4

4	2

I	4

my	4

I	4

still	3
waiting	1
for	4
that	4
call	3

I	4
will	4

it	4

cheap	1

I	4
ca	2
nt	2

a	5

do	4

this	4

Was	1
there	3
this	4
past	2
weekend	2
and	5
the	5
guy	2
behind	2
the	5
counter	1
yelled	0
at	4
me	3

my	4
son	1
because	3
we	3
believed	1
he	4
left	2
the	5
grandma	0
slice	1
in	4
the	5
oven	0
a	5
little	2
too	2
long	2
and	5
the	5
cheese	1
got	3
all	3
dried	1
out	3
and	5
the	5
slice	1
tasted	1
more	3
like	3
a	5
cracker	0
.	5

He	3
preceded	0
to	5
grab	1
the	5
slice	1
off	2
the	5
countertop	0
and	5
throw	1
it	4
into	3
the	5
trash	1
while	2
yelling	0
at	4
me	3

"	4
you	4

when	3

I	4

it	4

all	3

So	2
that	4
comment	1
is	4
completely	1
false	1
.	5

Because	1
we	3
think	3
IT	2
'S	0
THE	2
BEST	1
!!!	2

and	5
we	3
do	4
n't	4
know	3
them	3
except	1
for	4

there	3

Dr.	2
Strzalka	0
at	4
Flagship	0
CVTS	0
is	4
not	4
a	5
good	3
doctor	2

I	4
am	3
not	4
sure	2
about	3
the	5
quality	2
of	5
the	5
other	3
doctors	0
there	3
,	5
but	3
i	3
do	4
know	3
from	4
personal	1
experience	2
that	4
Dr.	2
Christopher	0
T.	0
Strzalka	0
is	4
not	4
a	5
man	2
of	5
his	3
word	2
,	5
and	5
is	4
also	3
very	3
CRUEL	0
AND	2
UNCARING	0
!!	2

He	3
was	4
going	3
to	5
operate	1
and	5
replace	1
my	4
bicuspid	0
aortic	0
valve	0
due	2
to	5
critical	0
aortic	0

I	4
had	3
a	5
surgery	1
date	2
of	5
July	2
17	1
,	5
2008	1
.	5

Then	2
he	4
renigged	0
when	3
he	4
read	2
my	4
Health	0
Care	1
Proxy	0
,	5
even	3
though	2
i	3
agreed	1
to	5
be	4
on	4
the	5
ventilator	0
for	4
2	3
months	2
following	2
surgery	1
(	4
as	4
he	4
had	3
twice	1
stated	1
i	3
must	2
agree	1
to	5
)	4
.	5

He	3
later	2
said	3
that	4
by	3
2	3
months	2
he	4
"	4
meant	1
at	4
least	2
two	3
months	2
"	4
.	5

Two	1
months	2
and	5
at	4
least	2
two	3
months	2
are	4
totally	1
different	2
things	2
.	5

He	3
did	3
not	4
even	3
give	2
me	3
the	5
chance	2
to	5
say	3
i	3
would	3
stay	2
on	4
the	5
ventilator	0
longer	2
,	5
which	3
i	3
would	3
have	4
.	5

A	3
Health	0
Care	1
Proxy	0
is	4
not	4
written	1
in	4
stone	0
and	5
can	3
be	4
changed	1

He	3
also	3
never	3
even	3
said	3
he	4
was	4
sorry	1
.	5

Just	2
said	3
i	3
was	4
inoperable	0
and	5
walked	1
out	3
of	5
the	5
hospital	1
room	2
.	5

So	2
,	5
therefore	1
,	5
now	3
he	4
says	2
i	3
am	3
inoperable	0
(	4
even	3
though	2
i	3
am	3
not	4
100	2
%	2
inoperable	0
)	4
,	5
and	5
he	4
is	4
letting	0
me	3
die	1
.	5

I	4
am	3
just	3
middle	1
aged	0
and	5
do	4
not	4
want	3
to	5
die	1
,	5
but	3
thanks	2
to	5
this	4
doctor	2
i	3
have	4
no	3
other	3
alternatives	1
.	5

I	4
,	5
along	2
with	4
my	4
friends	2
,	5
consider	1
this	4
doctor	2
to	5
be	4
the	5
cause	1
of	5
my	4
death	2
as	4
he	4
is	4
not	4
even	3
trying	2
to	5
save	1
my	4
life	2
by	3
operating	1

Even	2
my	4
PA	0
i	3
went	2
to	5
the	5

I	4

It	3

that	4

that	4

came	2
out	3
very	3
quickly	2
to	5
give	2
us	3
our	3
quote	1

They	3
were	3
very	3
polite	0
,	5
eager	1
to	5
answer	2
any	3
questions	2
and	5
willing	2
to	5
wait	2
for	4
us	3
to	5
return	2
from	4
vacation	1
to	5
begin	1
installing	0
our	3
fence	1

Our	2
fence	1
was	4
installed	0
quickly	2
in	4
August	1
and	5
they	4
had	3
their	3
money	2
and	5
left	2
saying	2
"	4
Workmanship	0
is	4
guaranteed	1
for	4
a	5
year	3

"	4
.	5

Within	0
a	5
week	2
we	3
noticed	1
one	3
of	5
the	5
boards	0
on	4
our	3
gate	0
splitting	0
where	2
a	5
nail	1
had	3
gone	2
in	4
.	5

We	3
called	2
our	3
representative	1
who	3
assured	1
me	3
he	4
would	3
call	3
the	5
office	2
and	5
have	4
it	4
taken	2
care	2
of	5
.	5

We	3
heard	2
nothing	2
.	5

We	3
then	3
called	2
the	5
office	2
and	5
the	5
man	2
we	3
spoke	1
to	5
said	3
he	4
'd	2
send	2
someone	2
out	3
to	5
look	2
at	4
it	4
but	3
could	3
n't	4
promise	1
when	3
-	4
two	3
weeks	2
came	2
and	5
went	2
and	5
we	3
heard	2
nothing	2
.	5

I	4
just	3
called	2
again	2
and	5
was	4
told	2
that	4
workmanship	0
,	5
not	4
wood	1
,	5
is	4
guaranteed	1
for	4
a	5
year	3
-	4
well	3
in	4
my	4
opinion	1
-	4
the	5
wood	1
split	1
due	2
to	5
a	5
nail	1
which	3
is	4
part	2
of	5
workmanship	0
!	3

She	2
even	3
went	2
so	3
far	2
as	4
to	5
say	3
"	4
You	3
r	1
calling	1
about	3
one	3
board	2
?	4
"	4

Well	2
-	4
when	3
you	4
pay	2
over	3
$	3
1000	1
for	4
something	2
you	4
want	3
it	4
to	5
hold	1
up	3
and	5
look	2
good	3
!!!	2

YES	1
!	3

I	4
WAS	1
calling	1
about	3
one	3
board	2
!!	2

I	4
'm	3
very	3
frustrated	0
at	4
this	4
point	2
-	4
it	4
would	3
take	3
all	3
of	5
10	2
min	0
for	4
them	3
to	5
come	2
by	3
and	5
replace	1
the	5
one	3
board	2
that	4
is	4
cracked	0
(	4
the	5
crack	0
is	4
deep	1
enough	2
to	5
stick	1
a	5
penny	1
in	4
it	4
and	5
it	4
goes	1
clear	2
through	2
)	4
yet	2
they	4
do	4
not	4
want	3
to	5
take	3
the	5
time	3
to	5
bother	1
with	4
what	3
once	2
WAS	1
a	5
happy	2
customer	2
and	5
has	3
now	3
become	2
a	5
dissatisfied	0
customer	2

So	2
I	4
figure	1
if	3
they	4
do	4
n't	4
want	3
to	5
take	3
the	5
time	3
to	5
fix	1
the	5
fence	1
that	4
they	4

then	3
I	4
'll	3
take	3
the	5
time	3
to	5
let	2
everyone	2
I	4
can	3
know	3
about	3
how	3
they	4
treat	1

they	4

your	4

SERVICE	1

After	2
happily	0
visiting	1
Sear's	0
Automotives	0
in	4
the	5
past	2
,	5
I	4
was	4
shocked	1
at	4
the	5
horrible	1
service	3
received	2
at	4
their	3
Greensboro	0
location	1
.	5

I	4
brought	1
my	4
car	2
in	4
on	4
a	5
Sunday	1
to	5
replace	1
a	5
shredded	0
tire	1
.	5

I	4
waited	1
about	3
20	2
minutes	2
in	4
the	5
store	2
part	2
before	3
anyone	2
was	4
able	2
to	5
assist	1
me	3
and	5
was	4
then	3
told	2
to	5
pull	1
my	4
car	2
into	3
the	5
shop	1
(	4
that	4
is	4
apparently	1
what	3
you	4
are	4
supposed	1
to	5
do	4
,	5
but	3
the	5
big	2
signs	1
pointing	0
you	4
that	4
way	3
are	4
for	4
some	3
reason	2
kept	2
inside	2
the	5
garage	1
,	5
so	3
you	4
do	4
n't	4
see	3
them	3
drving	0
up	3
,	5
and	5
they	4
purposely	0
block	1
the	5
front	2
pull	1
-	4
up	3
that	4
all	3
other	3
Sear's	0
use	3
)	4
.	5

Once	1
inside	2
,	5
I	4
had	3
to	5
stand	1
around	2
for	4
at	4
least	2
10	2
more	3
minutes	2
before	3
--	3
FINALLY	0
--	3
a	5
technician	0
got	3
to	5
me	3
.	5

Once	1
I	4
returned	1
to	5
pick	1
up	3
my	4
car	2
,	5
you	4
can	3
believe	2
I	4
spent	2
quite	2
a	5
bit	2
MORE	1
time	3
standing	1
around	2
waiting	1
.	5

I	4
had	3
wanted	2
to	5
split	1
the	5
total	1
between	2
a	5
credit	2
card	1
and	5
check	2
card	1
since	2
I	4
was	4
being	3
reimbursed	0
for	4
the	5
tire	1
but	3
was	4
told	2
this	4
was	4
n't	4
possible	2
.	5

Once	1
I	4
actually	2
got	3
back	3
in	4
my	4
car	2
,	5
it	4
was	4
dirty	1
and	5
had	3
grease	0
all	3
over	3
the	5
steering	0
wheel	1
.	5

OK	2
,	5
one	3
bad	2
experience	2
...	3
fine	2
.	5

The	4
following	2
Friday	2
,	5
I	4
returned	1
with	4
my	4
car	2
to	5
go	3
ahead	1
and	5
replace	1
the	5
other	3
3	3
tires	1
,	5
which	3
were	3
worn	0
.	5

I	4
would	3
not	4
have	4
gone	2
back	3
,	5
but	3
I	4
could	3
n't	4
find	2
the	5
particular	1
tire	1
they	4
'd	2
used	2
in	4
stock	1
anywhere	1
else	2
.	5

Once	1
again	2
,	5
I	4
waited	1
for	4
quite	2
a	5
bit	2
before	3
being	3
attended	1
to	5
.	5

I	4
got	3
the	5
order	2
completed	1
,	5
and	5
then	3
questioned	0
the	5
technician	0
since	2
it	4
came	2
out	3
about	3
$	3
40	1
less	2
than	3
I	4
expected	1
.	5

He	3
said	3
it	4
was	4
the	5
same	3
tire	1
,	5
and	5
verified	0
this	4
,	5
after	3
checking	1
both	2
the	5
actual	1
tire	1
on	4
my	4
car	2
and	5
my	4
service	3
papers	1
from	4
earlier	2
in	4
the	5
week	2
.	5

However	2
,	5
when	3
he	4
printed	1
out	3
the	5
service	3
quote	1
,	5
I	4
could	3
see	3
that	4
it	4
was	4
NOT	2
the	5
correct	1
tire	1
,	5
and	5
was	4
not	4
even	3
an	3
appropriate	1
tire	1
for	4
my	4
car	2
model	1
.	5

So	2
I	4
pointed	0
this	4
out	3
to	5
him	3
,	5
at	4
which	3
point	2
he	4
said	3
they	4
only	3
had	3
one	3
of	5
the	5
correct	1
tires	1
in	4
stock	1
.	5

Ok	1
--	3
fine	2
.	5

So	2
I	4
got	3
just	3
my	4
other	3
rear	1
tire	1
replaced	1
.	5

They	3
promised	1
it	4
'd	2
be	4
done	2
within	2
an	3
hour	1
,	5
so	3
I	4
waited	1
in	4
the	5
lobby	1
.	5

Over	1
two	3
hours	2
later	2
(	4
and	5
ten	1
minutes	2
before	3
they	4
closed	1
)	4
my	4
car	2
was	4
finally	1
finished	1
.	5

A	3
few	2
minutes	2
after	3
I	4
left	2
,	5
I	4
was	4
called	2
and	5
informed	1
that	4
"	4
I	4
"	4
left	2
my	4
wheel	1
lock	1
(	4
which	3
they	4
should	3
have	4
left	2
in	4
the	5
car	2
)	4
.	5

Of	1
course	2
,	5
they	4
would	3
be	4
closing	1
in	4
5	2
minutes	2
,	5
so	3
I	4
would	3
have	4
to	5
hurry	1
up	3
or	4
get	3
it	4
the	5
next	2
day	3
.	5

Of	1
course	2
I	4
could	3
n't	4
make	3
it	4
back	3
in	4
time	3
(	4
and	5
they	4
apparently	1
could	3
not	4
stay	2
5	2
extra	1
minutes	2
to	5
wait	2
for	4
me	3
)	4
.	5

The	4
next	2
day	3
,	5
no	3
one	3
could	3
find	2
my	4
wheel	1
lock	1
and	5
that	4
particular	1
technician	0
was	4
not	4
in	4
.	5

Of	1
course	2
,	5
they	4
could	3
n't	4
call	3
him	3
either	2
to	5
ask	2
about	3
it	4
because	3
apparently	1
they	4
do	4
n't	4
keep	2
their	3
employees	1
'	3
phone	2
numbers	1
(	4
riiight	0
)	4
,	5
so	3
I	4
would	3
have	4
to	5
return	2
on	4
Monday	2
(	4
driving	1
for	4
3	3
days	2
now	3
with	4
no	3
wheel	1
lock	1
should	3
I	4
get	3
a	5
flat	1
)	4
.	5

On	2
Monday	2
I	4
called	2
and	5
again	2
it	4
was	4
a	5
big	2
to	5
-	4
do	4
to	5
find	2
anyone	2
who	3
knew	1
anything	2
about	3
it	4
.	5

Supposedly	0
they	4
will	4
be	4
holding	1
it	4
for	4
me	3
this	4
evening	1
,	5
but	3
I	4
'm	3
sure	2
that	4
will	4
also	3
be	4
a	5
huge	1
ordeal	0
.	5

The	4
employees	1
at	4
this	4
Sear's	0
are	4
completely	1
apathetic	0
and	5
there	3
did	3
n't	4
seem	1
to	5
be	4
any	3
sort	1
of	5
management	1
that	4
I	4
could	3
see	3
.	5

I	4
will	4
never	3
return	2
there	3
again	2
(	4
and	5
now	3
have	4
some	3
serious	1
doubts	0
about	3
the	5
quality	2
of	5
work	3
they	4
actually	2
performed	1
on	4
my	4
