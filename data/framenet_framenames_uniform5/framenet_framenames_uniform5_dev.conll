You	0
and	4
I	2
have	3
done	1
some	2
important	2
work	2
together	1
.	4

We	1
've	0
helped	1
people	2
break	0
free	1
of	4
the	4
welfare	1
cycle	1
.	4

We	1
've	0
found	1
ways	0
for	3
people	2

to	4
enter	0
the	4
workforce	0
.	4

We	1
've	0
expanded	1
Goodwill	2
's	3
proven	0
methods	0
to	4
towns	0
and	4
neighborhoods	0
where	2
they	2
are	3
needed	1
most	2
.	4

Of	1
course	1
,	4
we	2
've	0
played	0
different	0
roles	0
.	4

You	0
have	3
helped	1
make	1
Goodwill	2
's	3
work	2
possible	1
with	3
your	1
previous	0
support	2

Goodwill	2
has	3
devised	0

on	3

There	2

physical	1

Dear	0
Joe	0
,	4

I	2
know	1
what	2
you	2
mean	0
about	2
being	1
a	3
journalist	0
.	4

Almost	0
every	1
assignment	0
is	3
a	3
challenge	0
in	3
a	3
different	0
way	1
and	4
it	3
never	1
seems	1
to	4
get	1
easier	0
.	4

I	2
often	1
feel	0
as	3
if	2
I	2
only	2
get	1
half	0
the	4
story	0
sometimes	1
,	4
so	2
I	2
typically	0
do	2
a	3
massive	1
amount	0
of	4
reporting	0
that	3
is	3
most	2
often	1
much	2
more	2
than	2
I	2
will	2
ever	1
need	1
.	4

I	2
think	1
that	3
is	3
why	1
I	2
welcomed	0
doing	0
a	3
book	0
--	2
it	3
gives	0
one	2
the	4
ability	1
to	4
use	2
so	2
much	2
of	4
what	2
is	3
left	1
on	3
the	4
cutting	0
room	1
floor	1
of	4
daily	0
journalism	0
.	4

Think	0
of	4
all	2
the	4
good	1
stuff	0
we	2
all	2
collect	0
daily	0
in	3
our	2
reporting	0
that	3
we	2
never	1
add	0
to	4
stories	0
.	4

Most	0
often	1
reporters	0
recount	0
these	2
tales	0
with	3
each	1
other	2
and	4
with	3
their	2
sources	2
rather	1
than	2
share	0
them	2
with	3
the	4
general	1
public	1
.	4

Much	0
of	4
it	3
,	4
of	4
course	1
,	4
using	1
the	4
standards	0
of	4
top	1
newspapers	0
,	4
can	2
not	3
be	3
used	2
since	2
it	3
is	3
largely	0
gossip	0
we	2
are	3
repeating	0
,	4
although	1
it	3
certainly	0
could	2
make	1
for	3
some	2
very	2
good	1
stories	0
.	4

I	2
often	1
wonder	0
when	2
a	3
really	1
great	1
fictional	0
book	0
will	2
be	3
written	0
about	2
this	2
era	1
(	3
probably	1
decades	1
and	4
decades	1
hence	0
as	3
it	3
is	3
too	1
close	1
)	3
.	4

In	2
any	2
case	1
,	4
there	2
certainly	0
is	3
no	2
lack	1
of	4
information	2
available	1
about	2
the	4
moguls	0
of	4
technology	2
now	2
as	3
they	2
all	2
become	1
our	2
current	1
pop	0
icons	0
.	4

I	2
would	2
posit	0
that	3
Bill	0
and	4
Michael	0
and	4
Steve	0
and	4
Jerry	1
have	3
become	1
the	4
Madonnas	0
of	4
the	4
current	1
age	0
of	4
stock	0
market	0
mania	0
and	4
celebration	0
of	4
the	4
entrepreneur	0
.	4

So	0
the	4
shift	0
in	3
the	4
image	0
of	4
Gates	0
has	3
been	2
an	3
interesting	0
one	2
for	3
me	1
to	4
watch	0
.	4

The	3
smart-boy	0
technologist	0
is	3
now	2
being	1
painted	0
as	3
the	4
whiny	0
bully	0
.	4

I	2
personally	0
always	1
thought	0
it	3
was	3
a	3
risk	0
to	4
pin	0
the	4
image	0
of	4
Microsoft	0
on	3
just	2
one	2
man	1
--	2
at	3
AOL	0
,	4
for	3
example	1
,	4
there	2
was	3
a	3
conscious	0
effort	1
to	4
develop	2
other	2
``	3
characters	0
,	4
''	2
for	3
lack	1
of	4
a	3
better	1
word	0
.	4

So	0
there	2
,	4
while	1
you	2
think	1
of	4
Case	0
,	4
you	2
also	2
think	1
of	4
Pittman	0
and	4
Leonsis	0
and	4
increasingly	0
a	3
range	2
of	4
other	2
executives	0
.	4

Steve	0
Ballmer	0
,	4
of	4
course	1
,	4
is	3
now	2
getting	0
a	3
lot	1
more	2
attention	0
at	3
Microsoft	0
,	4
but	2
it	3
still	2
seems	1
to	4
be	3
Bill	0
's	3
show	0
over	2
there	2
.	4

While	1
I	2
did	2
not	3
attend	0
the	4
trial	0
--	2
I	2
was	3
lucky	0
to	4
be	3
able	1
to	4
read	0
your	1
highly	1
amusing	0
and	4
informative	0
dispatches	0
,	4
several	2
of	4
which	2
made	2
me	1
spit	0
up	2
my	1
lunch	0
laughing	0
--	2
it	3
certainly	0
seemed	0
as	3
if	2
the	4
image	0
of	4
Bill	0
Gates	0
took	1
a	3
beating	0
and	4
the	4
insular	0
culture	1
of	4
Microsoft	0
did	2
not	3
look	1
so	2
good	1
.	4

That	1
's	3
ironic	0
,	4
since	2
I	2
think	1
it	3
was	3
just	2
that	3
insularity	0
that	3
helped	1
them	2
,	4
much	2
in	3
the	4
same	1
way	1
that	3
AOL	0
has	3
benefited	0
from	3
being	1
in	3
the	4
Virginia	0
suburbs	0
rather	1
than	2
in	3
Silicon	0
Valley	0
.	4

AOL	0
would	2
never	1
have	3
existed	0
if	2
it	3
had	2
been	2
founded	0
here	2
,	4
I	2
am	0
sure	1
,	4
since	2
its	3
employees	0
would	2
have	3
been	2
mocked	0
into	2
obscurity	0
by	3
the	4
digerati	0
.	4

Out	0
in	3
the	4
D.C.	0
area	2
,	4
they	2
looked	0
positively	0
exciting	0
next	2
to	4
all	2
the	4
government-oriented	0
contractors	0
.	4

I	2
wonder	0
if	2
that	3
means	1
geography	0
is	3
destiny	0
,	4
and	4
it	3
's	3
still	2
location	2
,	4
location	2
,	4
location	2
.	4

From	1
where	2
I	2
am	0
sitting	0
,	4
I	2
think	1
the	4
Microsoft	0
trial	0
has	3
been	2
the	4
really	1
obvious	0
turning	0
point	1
between	2
the	4
computer	1
era	1
and	4
the	4
digital	0
age	0
.	4

I	2
think	1
it	3
almost	1
does	1
not	3
matter	0
what	2
the	4
judge	0
does	1
since	2
it	3
's	3
clear	0
that	3
the	4
balance	0
of	4
power	2
is	3
shifting	0
again	1
,	4
although	1
it	3
not	3
clear	0
where	2
it	3
will	2
land	1
.	4

Will	0
the	4
strongman	0
of	4
the	4
era	1
be	3
AOL	0
,	4
AT	0
and	4
T	0
,	4
Microsoft	0
,	4
or	3
one	2
of	4
the	4
big	0
media	1
companies	2
?	2

Or	0
will	2
it	3
be	3
none	0
of	4
them	2
because	2
the	4
Internet	0
allows	0
and	4
encourages	0
a	3
plethora	0
of	4
strong	1
companies	2
and	4
a	3
complex	1
interconnection	0
of	4
businesses	0
where	2
none	0
are	3
allowed	1
to	4
dominate	0
?	2

I	2
always	1
use	2
two	2
simple	0
words	0
when	2
people	2
tell	0
me	1
that	3
one	2
company	1
--	2
whether	1
it	3
is	3
AOL	0
or	3
Microsoft	0

Disney	0
--	2
is	3
in	3
charge	0
of	4
all	2
our	2
destinies	0
:	3
Babylon	0
was	3

That	1
incredible	0
empire	1
dominated	0
the	4
world	2
and	4
I	2
imagine	0
it	3
did	2
not	3
seem	1

then	2
that	3
anyone	0
could	2

But	2
we	2

know	1
how	1

Now	0
I	2

this	2

Perhaps	0
you	2
