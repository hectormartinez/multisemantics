After	1
we	2
took	1
a	3
look	1
at	3
the	4
situation	1
,	4
we	2
found	1
that	3
the	4
best	1
solutions	0
to	4
stop	0
thousands	1
of	4
people	2
from	3
renouncing	0
their	2

to	4

.	4

Before	0
we	2
start	0
reviewing	0
the	4
events	0
that	3
accured	0
here	2
,	4
we	2
ask	0
two	2
questions:	0

First	1
:	3
If	2
there	2
were	2
people	2
who	2
are	3
raping	0
thousands	1
of	4
Muslim	0
women	1
taking	1
their	2
honor	0
,	4
and	4
stealing	0
muslim	0
money	1
and	4
land	1
,	4
and	4
other	2
people	2
who	2
do	2
n't	2
rape	0
or	3
steal	0
,	4
but	2
they	2
take	1
the	4
religion	1
away	1
from	3
thousands	1
of	4
Muslims	1
,	4
what	2
's	3
more	2
important	2
,	4
religion	1
,	4
or	3
honor	0
and	4
land	1
?	2

What	1
we	2
learned	1
from	3
Muslim	0
scholars	0
is	3
that	3
robbing	0
the	4
religion	1
from	3
Muslims	1
,	4
is	3
greater	1
than	2
robbing	0
their	2
honor	0
and	4
land	1
.	4

God	0
said	2
``	3
turmoil	0
is	3
greater	1
than	2
murder	0
''	2
,	4
and	4
for	3
those	1
devils	0
,	4
their	2
danger	0
is	3
greater	1
than	2
who	2
rapes	0
,	4
or	3
rob	0
and	4
steal	0
money	1
or	3
land	1
.	4

Second	1
question	0
:	3
Why	0
did	2
we	2
announce	0
and	4
started	1
fighting	1
the	4
Shiites	0
and	4
police	0
from	3
the	4
start	0
,	4
even	2
though	1
most	2
of	4
the	4
Jihadist	0
sectors	0
and	4
the	4
public	1
did	2
n't	2
understand	0
what	2
we	2
want	1
,	4
and	4
did	2
n't	2
know	1
the	4
importance	1
of	4
starting	0
with	3
those	1
?	2

So	0
what	2
's	3
the	4
objection	0
on	3
killing	0
and	4
executing	0
the	4
Sheiks	0
now	2
and	4
without	1
a	3
notice	0
,	4
with	3
continiuing	0
making	1
people	2
understand	0
it	3
,	4
just	2
like	1
we	2
did	2
by	3
killing	0
the	4
police	0
then	2
?	2

Were	0
people	2
satisfied	0
with	3
us	1
?	2

Actually	0
lot	1
of	4
the	4
public	1
thinks	0
that	3
who	2
killed	0
the	4
police	0
is	3
Badr	0
organization	1
or	3
gangs	0
from	3
Iran	3
!	1

And	1
that	3
who	2
's	3
killing	0
Shiites	0
is	3
hired	0
by	3
Israel	2
and	4
the	4
U.S.	2
to	4
start	0
an	3
ethnic	0
war	2
and	4
so	2
on	3
.	4

From	1
what	2
we	2
saw	1
,	4
the	4
damage	0
caused	0
by	3
those	1
erratic	0
infidels	0
(	3
Tribes	0
Sheiks	0
,	4
The	3
Islamic	1
Party	0
)	3
is	3
more	2
dangerous	1
than	2
the	4
Shiites	0
and	4
the	4
peaceful	1
police	0
as	3
people	2
call	0
them	2
.	4

You	0
Sheik	0
announced	1
war	2
on	3
those	1
,	4
with	3
the	4
opposings	0
of	4
many	2
sectors	0
and	4
scholars	0
of	4
decision	0
making	1
.	4

The	3
brothers	0
now	2
are	3
wiping	0
out	2
the	4
heads	0
of	4
infidelity	0
,	4
as	3
soon	0
as	3
they	2
started	1
,	4
and	4
never	1
claiming	0
responsibility	0
,	4
we	2
found	1
among	1
us	1
who	2
wants	1
to	4
make	1
fuss	0
about	2
it	3
,	4
and	4
regretfully	0
some	2
of	4
the	4
brothers	0
with	3
us	1
in	3
the	4
organization	1
(	3
al-Qa'ida	0
)	3
see	1
it	3
as	3
nonsense	0
,	4
and	4
God	0
is	3
my	1
witness	0
.	4

My	0
Sheik	0
,	4
here	2
's	3
some	2
of	4
the	4
events	0
that	3
happened	0
in	3
Ramadi	0
:	3

1-	1
Sheik	0
Nasr	0
al-Fahdawi	0
,	4
Sheik	0
of	4
AlbuFahd	0

,	4
was	3
nominated	0
to	4
be	3
the	4
governor	0
of	4
Anbar	0
,	4
this	2
man	1
worked	1
so	2
hard	1
fighting	1
the	4
(	3
Tanzim	0
)	3
organization	1
,	4
with	3
all	2
he	2
's	3
got	1
,	4
from	3
money	1
to	4
power	2
,	4
and	4
reputation	0
in	3
Ramadi	0
.	4

So	0
we	2
tried	0
this	2
with	3
him	1
:	3
First	1
,	4
we	2
backed	0
off	1
during	2
the	4

They	2
had	2

they	2
violated	0
our	2
brothers	0
many	2
times	1

They	2
even	2
announced	1
it	3

then	2
our	2

,	4
the	4
brain	0
behind	0
people	2
revolting	0
at	3
al-Anbar	0

So	0
the	4

They	2
took	1
him	1

killed	0
him	1
.	4

Thank	0
God	0

The	3
next	2

the	4

Uh	0
but	2
as	3

as	3
the	4

,	4
i	0
would	2
have	3
to	4

this	2

i	0
believe	1
from	3
Florida	0
and	4
she	1
just	2
has	3
just	2
really	1
stiff	0

and	4
i	0
saw	1
that	3
in	3
in	3
the	4
hands	1
of	4
a	3

that	3
really	1

and	4
really	1
,	4
you	2

took	1
the	4

to	4
give	1
a	3
sentence	0
for	3
what	2
was	3
deserved	0
,	4
it	3
could	2
-	3
you	2
could	2
have	3
a	3
-	3
a	3
judge	0
that	3
would	2
really	1
make	1
a	3
good	1
impact	0
,	4
but	2
likewise	0
you	2
could	2
have	3
the	4
flip	0
side	1
and	4
have	3
some	2
judge	0
that	3
was	3
paid	1
off	1
or	3
you	2
know	1
had	2
good	1

a	3
good	1

you	2

you	2

So	0
,	4
at	3

the	4
jury	0

does	1
something	0
to	4
prevent	1
that	3

you	2

I	2
do	2
n't	2
know	1

it	3
but	2
seems	1

i	0
also	2

One	1
of	4
Sherlock	0
Holmes	0
's	3
defects	0
--	2
if	2
,	4
indeed	0
,	4
one	2
may	2
call	0
it	3
a	3
defect	0
--	2
was	3
that	3
he	2
was	3
exceedingly	0
loath	0
to	4
communicate	0
his	2
full	1
plans	1
to	4
any	2
other	2
person	0
until	1
the	4
instant	0
of	4
their	2
fulfilment	0
.	4

Partly	0
it	3
came	2
no	2
doubt	0
from	3
his	2
own	2
masterful	0
nature	1
,	4
which	2
loved	0
to	4
dominate	0
and	4
surprise	0
those	1
who	2
were	2
around	2
him	1
.	4

Partly	0
also	2
from	3
his	2
professional	0
caution	0
,	4
which	2
urged	0
him	1
never	1
to	4
take	1
any	2
chances	0
.	4

The	3
result	1
,	4
however	2
,	4
was	3
very	2
trying	1
for	3
those	1
who	2
were	2
acting	0
as	3
his	2
agents	2
and	4
assistants	0
.	4

I	2
had	2
often	1
suffered	0
under	2
it	3
,	4
but	2
never	1
more	2
so	2
than	2
during	2
that	3
long	2
drive	0
in	3
the	4
darkness	0
.	4

The	3
great	1
ordeal	0
was	3
in	3
front	1
of	4
us	1
;	2
at	3
last	1
we	2
were	2
about	2
to	4
make	1
our	2
final	1
effort	1
,	4
and	4
yet	1
Holmes	0
had	2
said	2
nothing	0
,	4
and	4
I	2
could	2
only	2
surmise	0
what	2
his	2
course	1
of	4
action	1
would	2
be	3
.	4

My	0
nerves	0
thrilled	0
with	3
anticipation	0
when	2
at	3
last	1
the	4
cold	0
wind	0
upon	1
our	2
faces	0
and	4
the	4
dark	0
,	4
void	0
spaces	0
on	3
either	1
side	1
of	4
the	4
narrow	0
road	0
told	1
me	1
that	3
we	2
were	2
back	1
upon	1
the	4
moor	0
once	1
again	1
.	4

Every	0
stride	0
of	4
the	4
horses	0
and	4
every	1
turn	1
of	4
the	4
wheels	0
was	3
taking	1
us	1
nearer	0
to	4
our	2
supreme	0
adventure	0
.	4

Our	0
conversation	0
was	3
hampered	0
by	3
the	4
presence	1
of	4
the	4
driver	0
of	4
the	4
hired	0
wagonette	0
,	4
so	2
that	3
we	2
were	2
forced	1
to	4
talk	0
of	4
trivial	0
matters	0
when	2
our	2
nerves	0
were	2
tense	0
with	3
emotion	0
and	4
anticipation	0
.	4

It	2
was	3
a	3
relief	0
to	4
me	1
,	4
after	2
that	3
unnatural	0
restraint	0
,	4
when	2
we	2
at	3
last	1
passed	0
Frankland	0
's	3
house	1
and	4
knew	0
that	3
we	2
were	2
drawing	0
near	2
to	4
the	4

In	2
