Dear	_

A	_

you	_
received	TARGET
a	_

from	_
me	_
telling	TARGET
the	_
success	TARGET

got	TARGET

Here	_

another	TARGET

an	_
unlikely	TARGET

Goodwill	_

She	_
tells	TARGET

that	_
the	_
3,666	_

we	_
helped	TARGET
find	TARGET
jobs	TARGET
in	TARGET
1998	_
earned	TARGET
approximately	TARGET

49	_

In	_

by	_
an	_

4	_

Your	_

Goodwill	_
will	_
help	TARGET
us	_
do	_
even	_

Some	_

the	_

our	_
welfare	_

are	_
the	_
people	TARGET
who	_
have	_
become	TARGET
dependent	_
on	_
it	_
.	_

Their	_
complaint	TARGET
:	_
the	_
system	TARGET
discourages	TARGET
working	TARGET
because	TARGET

provides	TARGET
benefits	_
that	_
many	TARGET

Dear	_
Name	_

When	TARGET
Jerry	_
was	_
released	TARGET
from	_

he	_
knew	TARGET
it	_
would	_
take	TARGET
hard	TARGET
work	TARGET
and	_
determination	_
to	_
straighten	_
out	_
his	_
life	_
.	_

He	_
knew	TARGET
he	_
had	_
made	TARGET
a	_
bad	TARGET
mistake	_
,	_
but	_
despite	_
his	_
commitment	TARGET
to	_
rebuilding	_
his	_
life	_
,	_
he	_
just	_
did	_
n't	_
count	TARGET
on	_
the	_
obstacles	_
that	_
would	_
be	_
thrown	TARGET
up	_
in	TARGET
his	_
path	TARGET
.	_

Reality	_
hit	TARGET
when	TARGET
he	_
was	_
unable	TARGET
to	_
reconcile	_
with	_
his	_
wife	TARGET
and	_
ended	TARGET
up	_
on	_
the	_
street	TARGET

He	_
went	TARGET
to	_
the	_
Center	_
Township	_

until	TARGET
he	_
could	TARGET
find	TARGET
a	_

Jerry	_

did	_

end	TARGET
there	_

Prehistoric	TARGET
man	_
in	TARGET
Asia	_
Minor	_
(	_
now	_
modern	TARGET
Turkey	_
)	_
or	_
Greece	_
could	TARGET
look	TARGET
out	_
across	_
the	_
Aegean	_
toward	_
the	_
horizon	_
and	_
see	TARGET
the	_
faint	_
silhouette	_
of	TARGET
land	_
.	_

Their	_
curiosity	_
pushed	TARGET
them	_
to	_
build	TARGET
vessels	TARGET
that	_
were	_
strong	TARGET
enough	TARGET
to	_
ford	TARGET
the	_
open	_
seas	TARGET
and	_
reach	TARGET
these	_
islands	TARGET
,	_
marking	TARGET
the	_
start	TARGET
of	_
the	_
long	TARGET
legacy	_
of	_
Mediterranean	_
seafaring	_
.	_

Around	_
7000	_
b.c.	_
,	_
the	_
Phoenicians	_
set	_
out	TARGET
from	_
what	_
is	_
now	TARGET
Iran	_
to	_
explore	TARGET
their	_
surroundings	_
.	_

They	_
eventually	TARGET
reached	TARGET
the	_
islands	TARGET

and	_
founded	TARGET
colonies	TARGET
on	TARGET
the	_
islands	TARGET
in	TARGET
the	_
northernmost	TARGET

the	_
Aegean	_
Sea	TARGET

material	TARGET

obsidian	_
,	_
was	_
discovered	TARGET
on	TARGET
the	_
island	TARGET

Milos	_

Obsidian	_
is	_
a	_
hard	_

rock	_
,	_
which	_
could	_
be	_
fashioned	TARGET
into	_
tools	TARGET

cutting	TARGET

The	_
high	TARGET
quality	_
of	_
the	_
seam	_
on	TARGET
Milos	_
ensured	_
that	_
the	_
area	TARGET
remained	TARGET
popular	TARGET
with	_
early	TARGET
travelers	TARGET

The	_
basic	TARGET
elements	TARGET

A	_
series	_
of	_
disastrous	TARGET

at	_

sound	TARGET
a	_
death	TARGET
knell	_
for	_
the	_
Ottoman	_

The	_
Turks	_
lost	TARGET
a	_

were	_
forced	TARGET
to	_
relinquish	TARGET
the	_

Greece	_
took	_
this	_

absorb	_
the	_
islands	TARGET

the	_
northern	TARGET

Following	TARGET
this	_

the	_
Ottomans	TARGET

allied	_
themselves	_

the	_

Greece	_
was	_
handed	TARGET
a	_
strip	TARGET

land	_
along	_
the	_
western	TARGET
coast	TARGET
of	_
Asia	_

,	_
which	_
for	_
over	_
2,000	_
years	TARGET
had	_

substantial	_
Greek	TARGET
population	TARGET

Greece	_
moved	_
in	_
to	_
administer	TARGET
the	_
land	_
,	_
but	_
a	_
new	TARGET
influence	TARGET
upset	TARGET
any	_

this	_

Greece	_

In	TARGET
1923	_

Turkey	_
broke	_
away	_
from	_
the	_
tired	TARGET
Ottoman	TARGET
rulers	TARGET
,	_
and	_
Kemal	_
Ataturk	_
rose	TARGET
to	_
power	TARGET
on	_
a	_
wave	TARGET

popular	TARGET
support	_

He	_
promised	TARGET
a	_
modern	TARGET
state	TARGET
for	_
his	_
people	TARGET
,	_
but	_
as	_
the	_
situation	_
became	TARGET
volatile	_
,	_
civil	_
strife	TARGET
broke	TARGET
out	_
in	TARGET
Turkish	TARGET
cities	TARGET
,	_
and	_
those	_
considered	TARGET
Greek	TARGET
were	_
victims	TARGET
of	_
threats	TARGET
and	_
violence	_
.	_

Many	_
had	TARGET
to	_
leave	TARGET
their	_
birthplaces	_

Lesvos	_
,	_
Chios	_
,	_
and	_
Samos	_
,	_
the	_
Greek-ruled	_
islands	TARGET

Thousands	TARGET

people	TARGET
arrived	TARGET
with	_
little	_
more	TARGET
than	_
the	_

putting	TARGET
great	_
strain	_
on	_
the	_
resources	_

the	_
islands	TARGET

Finally	TARGET
,	_
Greece	_
was	_
ousted	TARGET
from	_
its	_

territory	TARGET
in	TARGET
Asia	_
Minor	_
,	_
which	_
became	TARGET
part	TARGET

the	_
new	TARGET
Turkish	TARGET

Greece	_
attempted	TARGET
to	_
stay	TARGET
out	_
of	_
World	_
War	TARGET
II	_
,	_
but	_
Mussolini	_
saw	TARGET
Greece	_
as	_
an	_
ideal	TARGET
addition	_
to	_
his	_
Italian	TARGET
empire	TARGET
.	_

His	_
forces	TARGET
made	_
a	_
series	_

attacks	TARGET
from	_
their	_
bases	TARGET
in	TARGET
the	_
Dodecanese	_

sinking	_

naval	TARGET

in	TARGET
the	_
harbor	TARGET

they	_
only	_
succeeded	TARGET

the	_
population	TARGET

them	_

Later	TARGET
the	_
Germans	TARGET
came	TARGET
in	_
force	TARGET

occupied	_
many	TARGET

After	TARGET
the	_
war	TARGET

in	TARGET
1949	_
,	_
the	_
Dodecanese	_
islands	TARGET
finally	TARGET
became	TARGET

Greek	TARGET
nation	TARGET

But	_
the	_
country	TARGET
was	_
politically	_

with	_
arguments	TARGET
between	_
monarchists	_

A	_
Brief	_
History	_

Jerusalem	_

history	_

with	_
its	_
mention	TARGET
in	_
Egyptian	_
court	TARGET
records	_
4,000	_
years	TARGET
ago	TARGET

but	_
there	_
had	_
been	TARGET
human	TARGET
settlements	TARGET
here	_
for	_
centuries	TARGET

probably	TARGET
millennia	TARGET

before	TARGET
that	_

At	TARGET
the	_
beginning	TARGET
of	_
the	_
second	TARGET
millennium	_
b.c.	_

Jerusalem	_
was	_
a	_
Canaanite	_
mountain	TARGET
stronghold	_
on	TARGET
a	_
secondary	_
trade	TARGET

less	_

Hazor	_

The	_
earliest	TARGET
name	TARGET
associated	TARGET
with	_
the	_
city	TARGET

Ur	_

perhaps	_
meant	TARGET
``	_

``	_
founded	TARGET

Scholars	_
speculate	TARGET
that	_
Shalim	_
might	TARGET
have	_
been	_
an	_
ancient	TARGET
Semitic	_
deity	_
of	_
peace	_
,	_
for	_
the	_
name	TARGET
resembles	TARGET
the	_
modern	_
Hebrew	_

words	TARGET

``	_

shalom	_

If	_
true	_

this	_

of	_

stretches	TARGET
to	_
23,000	_
b.c.	_

when	_

Around	TARGET
3000	_
b.c.	_

By	_

with	_
one	TARGET
exception	_

the	_

of	_
artesian	_
springs	TARGET
that	_
bubbled	TARGET
to	_
the	_
surface	TARGET

utilized	TARGET
such	_

off	_
all	TARGET

The	_
following	_
should	TARGET
be	_
considered	TARGET
when	TARGET
erecting	TARGET
fences:	_

1-	_
The	_
fence	_
which	_
is	_
built	TARGET
out	_
of	_
bricks	_
or	_
concrete	_
should	TARGET
be	_
4	TARGET
meters	TARGET
high	TARGET
,	_
then	_
topped	_
with	_
one	TARGET
meter	_
high	TARGET
barbed	_
wire	TARGET
fence	_

It	_
is	_
preferable	_
that	_
the	_
barbed	_
wires	TARGET
slant	_
outwards	_
at	_
a	_
70	_
degrees	_
angle	_
.	_

2-	_
The	_
thickness	_
of	_
the	_
fence	_
should	_
be	_
60	TARGET
cm	TARGET
and	_
the	_
distance	_
between	_
it	_
and	_
the	_
building	TARGET
should	TARGET
be	_
2	TARGET
meters	TARGET
.	_

3-	_
Secret	TARGET
gates	_
should	TARGET
be	_
built	TARGET
50	TARGET
meters	TARGET
apart	_
to	_
be	_
used	TARGET
for	_
emergency	_
only	_
.	_

However	_
,	_
they	_
should	TARGET
not	_
be	_
identifiable	_
from	_
the	_
outside	TARGET
part	TARGET
of	_
the	_
fence	_

4-	_
It	_
is	_
preferable	_
that	_
any	_
location	TARGET
has	_
only	_
2	TARGET
emergency	_
gates	_
and	_
far	_
away	_
from	_
one	_
another	_

5-	_
No	_
other	TARGET
outside	TARGET
gates	_
should	TARGET
be	_
erected	TARGET

If	_
it	_
is	_
necessary	TARGET
to	_
have	TARGET
an	_
outside	TARGET
entrance	_
for	_
the	_
control	TARGET
tower	TARGET
,	_
then	_
access	TARGET
to	_
the	_
location	TARGET
should	TARGET
not	_
be	_
constructed	TARGET

6-	_
If	_
the	_
location	TARGET
is	_
in	_
a	_
highly	_
dangerous	TARGET
zone	TARGET
,	_
then	_
two	TARGET
parallel	_
fences	_
should	TARGET
be	_
built	TARGET
to	_
be	_
3	TARGET
meters	TARGET
apart	_
.	_

The	_
space	_
between	_
the	_
two	TARGET
fences	_
could	TARGET
be	_
mined	_
in	_
order	_
to	_
prevent	TARGET
infiltration	_
.	_

7-	_
It	_
is	_
preferable	_
the	_
fence	_
be	_
square	_
or	_
rectangular	_
in	_
shape	TARGET
.	_

A	_
circular	TARGET
shaped	_

is	_
harder	TARGET

Defining	_
Terrorism	TARGET

Before	TARGET
assessing	TARGET
the	_
threat	TARGET
of	_
CBW	_
terrorism	TARGET
,	_
we	_
need	TARGET
to	_
define	TARGET
the	_
word	TARGET
``	_
terrorism	TARGET

''	_

For	_
political	_
reasons	TARGET

no	_
single	TARGET
definition	TARGET

been	_
accepted	TARGET
worldwide	_
and	_
several	TARGET
different	TARGET

in	_
current	_
use	TARGET
.	_

The	_
U.S.	_
Federal	_
Bureau	_
of	_
Investigation	_
(	_
FBI	_
)	_
defines	TARGET
terrorism	TARGET
as	_
:	_
``	_
The	_
unlawful	TARGET
use	TARGET
of	_
force	_
and	_
violence	_
against	_
persons	TARGET

property	TARGET

any	_
segment	TARGET

of	_
political	_

social	_
objectives	TARGET

''	_

The	_
U.S.	_
State	_
Department	_
defines	TARGET
terrorism	TARGET
differently	_
,	_
as	_
:	_
``	_
Premeditated	_

to	_
influence	TARGET
an	_
audience	_

Terrorism	TARGET

outside	_

also	_
developed	TARGET
their	_

definitions	TARGET

defines	TARGET
terrorism	TARGET

Some	_
definitions	TARGET
of	_
terrorism	TARGET

beyond	_
sub	_

include	TARGET

carry	TARGET

Differences	TARGET
between	_
Chemical	TARGET
and	_
Biological	_
Weapons	TARGET

In	_
discussing	TARGET
CBW	_
terrorism	TARGET
,	_
it	_
is	_
important	TARGET
to	_
distinguish	TARGET
between	_
terrorist	TARGET
attacks	TARGET
involving	_
chemical	TARGET
and	_
biological	TARGET
warfare	TARGET
agents	TARGET
,	_
which	_
differ	TARGET
in	_
several	TARGET
ways:	_

Chemical	_
warfare	TARGET
(	_
CW	TARGET
)	_
agents	TARGET
are	_
non-living	TARGET
,	_
manufactured	TARGET
chemicals	TARGET
that	_
are	_
highly	_
toxic	TARGET
and	_
can	TARGET
enter	TARGET
the	_
body	TARGET
through	_
the	_
lungs	_
or	_
the	_
skin	TARGET
.	_

They	_
cause	TARGET
illness	TARGET
or	_
death	TARGET
within	_
minutes	TARGET
to	_
hours	TARGET
after	TARGET
exposure	_
.	_

Biological	TARGET
warfare	TARGET
(	_
BW	TARGET
)	_
agents	TARGET
are	_
microorganisms	_
such	_
as	_
viruses	_
and	_
bacteria	_
that	_
infect	_
humans	TARGET
,	_
livestock	_
,	_
or	_
crops	TARGET
and	_
cause	TARGET
an	_
incapacitating	_
or	_
fatal	TARGET
disease	TARGET
.	_

Symptoms	_
of	_
illness	TARGET
do	_
not	_
appear	TARGET
immediately	_
but	_
only	_
after	TARGET
a	_
delay	_
,	_
or	_
``	_
incubation	_
period	_
,	_
''	_
that	_
may	_
last	_
for	_
days	TARGET
to	_
weeks	TARGET

Toxins	TARGET

in	_
a	_
gray	_
area	_
between	_
CW	TARGET

BW	TARGET
agents	TARGET
.	_

They	_
generally	_
have	_
an	_
incubation	_
period	_

hours	TARGET

days	TARGET

longer	TARGET

Why	_
Would	_
Terrorists	TARGET
Want	TARGET
to	_
Employ	TARGET
CBW	_
?	_

There	_
are	TARGET
several	TARGET
reasons	TARGET
why	_
certain	TARGET
terrorist	TARGET
groups	TARGET
or	_
individuals	TARGET
might	TARGET
favor	TARGET
the	_
use	TARGET
of	_
CBW	_
over	_
other	TARGET
kinds	TARGET
of	_
weapons:	_

If	_
used	TARGET
effectively	_
,	_
CBW	_
are	_
potentially	_
capable	TARGET
of	_
inflicting	_
a	_
large	TARGET
number	TARGET
of	_
casualties	_
--	_
more	_
than	_
is	_
possible	TARGET
with	_
conventional	_
explosives	TARGET
.	_

CBW	_
can	_
have	_
a	_
greater	_
psychological	_
impact	_
than	_
conventional	_
explosives	TARGET
,	_
as	_
suggested	_
by	_
the	_
2001	_
anthrax	_
letter	TARGET
attacks	TARGET
,	_
which	_
killed	TARGET
only	_
five	TARGET
people	TARGET
but	_
frightened	TARGET
millions	TARGET
of	_
Americans	TARGET
.	_

Terrorists	TARGET
may	TARGET
seek	TARGET
to	_
obtain	TARGET
greater	_
status	_
or	_
bargaining	_
power	_
by	_
demonstrating	TARGET
that	_
they	_
have	TARGET
the	_
technological	_
capabilities	TARGET
required	TARGET
to	_
develop	TARGET
,	_
produce	TARGET
,	_
and	_
deliver	TARGET
CBW	_
agents	TARGET
.	_

Although	_
CBW	_
agents	TARGET
are	_
not	_
nearly	_
as	_
destructive	TARGET
as	_
nuclear	_
weapons	TARGET
,	_
they	_
are	_
much	_
easier	TARGET
and	_
cheaper	TARGET
to	_
acquire	TARGET
.	_

The	_
psychology	_
or	_
ideology	_
of	_
a	_
particular	TARGET
terrorist	TARGET
group	TARGET
or	_
individual	TARGET
may	TARGET
lead	TARGET
to	_
a	_
fascination	_
with	_
poisons	TARGET

Technical	_
Capability	TARGET

The	_

to	_
recruit	_

these	_

Historically	TARGET

very	_

possessed	_
the	_
motivation	TARGET

particularly	_
on	_
a	_

Some	_
groups	TARGET
in	_
the	_
past	_
have	_
tried	TARGET
to	_

a	_

have	_
lacked	_
the	_

have	_
been	_

Is	_
the	_
number	_

increasing	TARGET

and	_
the	_
anthrax	_

of	_

,	_
analysts	TARGET
began	TARGET

observe	TARGET
some	_
troubling	TARGET
developments	TARGET
along	_
all	_
three	TARGET
dimensions	_
of	_
the	_
CBW	_
terrorism	TARGET
threat	TARGET

A	_

mass	_

Motivation	TARGET

In	_
the	_
past	_
,	_
politically	_
motivated	_
terrorist	TARGET
organizations	TARGET
,	_
such	_
as	_
the	_
Provisional	_
Irish	_
Republican	_
Army	_
(	_
PIRA	_
)	_
or	_
the	_
Palestinian	_
Liberation	_
Organization	_
(	_
PLO	_
)	_
,	_
have	_
not	_
sought	TARGET
to	_
inflict	_
indiscriminate	_
mass	_
casualties	_
.	_

Such	_
groups	TARGET
engage	TARGET
in	_
violent	_
attacks	TARGET
against	_
civilian	_
targets	_
with	_
the	_
aim	TARGET
of	_
influencing	TARGET
public	_
opinion	TARGET
and	_
applying	_
pressure	TARGET
on	_
government	TARGET
officials	TARGET
.	_

Nevertheless	_
,	_
it	_
would	_
be	_
counterproductive	_
for	_
politically	_
motivated	_
terrorists	TARGET
to	_
inflict	_
too	_
many	TARGET
casualties	_
,	_
for	_
two	TARGET
reasons:	_

These	_
groups	TARGET
have	_
an	_
outside	_
constituency	_
that	_
would	_
be	_
alienated	_
by	_
indiscriminate	_
or	_
disproportionate	_
attacks	TARGET
,	_
potentially	_
triggering	_
a	_
political	_
backlash	_
.	_

Mass	_
-	_
casualty	TARGET
attacks	TARGET
would	_
provoke	TARGET
government	TARGET
authorities	TARGET
to	_
pursue	TARGET
the	_
terrorists	TARGET
so	_
aggressively	_
that	_
they	_
would	_
ultimately	_
be	_
destroyed	TARGET
as	_
a	_
viable	_
organization	TARGET

scene	_

In	_
general	_
,	_
these	_
groups	TARGET
are	_
more	_
prepared	TARGET
to	_
inflict	_
indiscriminate	_
casualties	TARGET
because	TARGET
they	_
are	_
not	_
driven	TARGET

rather	_
by	_
irrational	TARGET

There	_
are	_
several	_
reasons	TARGET
why	_
Iran	_
would	_
pursue	_
a	_

including	TARGET
establishing	TARGET

Some	_

that	_

possess	TARGET

In	_
August	_
1989	_

Iran	_
was	_
accused	TARGET

purchase	TARGET
strains	TARGET

which	_
could	_

Bruno	_

was	_
doubtful	TARGET
that	_

use	TARGET

While	_
the	_
two	_
strains	TARGET

requested	TARGET
are	_
in	_
fact	_
dangerous	_
to	_
animal	_

human	_

Schiefer	_
contended	TARGET
that	_
the	_

Contravening	_
his	_
own	_
argument	TARGET

Schiefer	_
also	_

a	_
double	_

In	_
the	_
mid	TARGET

1970s	_

Iran	_
initiated	_
a	_

Iran	_

prompted	TARGET
much	_
concern	TARGET
regarding	TARGET
its	_

the	_
United	_

has	_
vehemently	_
opposed	TARGET
the	_

The	_
United	_

believes	TARGET
that	_

in	_
a	_

It	_
fears	TARGET
that	_

a	_
cover	_
for	_
the	_

Russia	_

has	_
expressed	TARGET
its	_

Iran	_
has	_
denied	TARGET
the	_

argues	TARGET

American	TARGET
concerns	TARGET
over	_
Iran	_
's	_
nuclear	_
program	TARGET
intensified	_
in	_
mid	TARGET
-	_
2002	_
,	_
when	_
American	TARGET
intelligence	_
learned	TARGET
of	_
the	_
existence	TARGET
of	_
two	_
secret	TARGET
nuclear	_

According	_
to	TARGET
an	_
Iranian	TARGET
opposition	_
group	TARGET

the	_
two	_
sites	TARGET

a	_
uranium	TARGET

In	_
February	_
2003	_
,	_
Iranian	TARGET
leaders	TARGET
announced	TARGET
a	_
new	TARGET
plan	TARGET
to	_
develop	TARGET
a	_
nuclear	_
energy	_
plan	TARGET
using	TARGET
entirely	_
domestic	TARGET
resources	_
.	_

This	_
development	TARGET
is	_
of	_
particular	TARGET
concern	TARGET
,	_
considering	_
the	_
revelation	TARGET
of	_
the	_
two	_
secret	TARGET
facilities	TARGET

The	_
United	_
States	_
believes	TARGET
that	_
these	_
facilities	TARGET
might	_
contribute	_
to	_
Iran	_
's	_
development	TARGET
of	_
a	_
complete	TARGET
nuclear	_
fuel	_
cycle	_
,	_
which	_
would	_
enable	_
Iran	_
to	_
build	TARGET
nuclear	_

without	_
importing	TARGET
nuclear	_
material	TARGET
.	_

Later	_
in	_
February	_
2003	_
,	_
an	_
IAEA	_
delegation	_
visited	TARGET
the	_
pilot	_

centrifuge	_
enrichment	TARGET
plant	TARGET
at	_
Natanz	_
,	_
which	_
is	_
nearly	_
ready	TARGET
for	_
operation	_

The	_
inspection	TARGET
team	TARGET
learned	TARGET
that	_
Iran	_
has	_
the	_
capability	TARGET
to	_
build	TARGET
more	TARGET
centrifuges	TARGET
.	_

During	_
the	_
IAEA	_
's	_
visit	TARGET
to	_
Iran	_
,	_
Iranian	_
officials	TARGET
indicated	TARGET
that	_
Iran	_
would	_
honor	_
its	_
safeguards	TARGET
agreement	TARGET
with	_
the	_
IAEA	_
,	_
but	_
did	_
not	_
clearly	_
indicate	TARGET
Iran	_
's	_
willingness	TARGET
to	_
accept	TARGET
the	_
Additional	_
Protocol	_
.	_

This	_
means	TARGET
that	_
Iran	_
will	_
place	TARGET
the	_
Natanz	_
facility	TARGET
,	_
and	_
any	_
enriched	TARGET
uranium	TARGET
it	_
produces	TARGET
,	_
under	_
IAEA	_
inspection	TARGET
but	_
that	_
,	_
as	_
long	_
as	_
no	_
nuclear	_
materials	TARGET
are	_
present	_
,	_
the	_
IAEA	_
would	_
have	_
no	_
ability	TARGET
to	_
examine	TARGET
locations	TARGET
in	_
Iran	_
where	_
it	_
believed	TARGET
nuclear	_
weapons	TARGET
design	TARGET
research	TARGET
might	_
be	_
under	_
way	_
.	_

The	_
United	_
States	_
is	_
concerned	TARGET
that	_
if	_
Iran	_
stockpiled	TARGET
enriched	TARGET
uranium	TARGET
,	_
it	_
might	_
,	_
in	_
the	_
future	_
,	_
withdraw	TARGET
from	_
the	_
NPT	_
(	_
as	_
North	_
Korea	_
has	_
)	_
and	_
then	_
build	TARGET
nuclear	_
weapons	TARGET
rapidly	_
,	_
perhaps	_
even	_
in	_
a	_
matter	_
of	_
months	_
.	_

It	_
is	_
possible	TARGET
that	_
construction	TARGET
of	_
the	_
Natanz	_
plant	TARGET
violated	TARGET
Iran	_
's	_
IAEA	_
safeguards	TARGET
obligations	TARGET
.	_

Such	_
a	_
violation	TARGET
would	_
have	_
occurred	TARGET
if	_
Iran	_
introduced	_
nuclear	_
material	TARGET
into	_
the	_
facility	TARGET
to	_
test	TARGET
it	_
,	_
without	_
informing	TARGET
the	_
IAEA	_
.	_

Reports	TARGET
in	_
the	_
Western	_
media	_
in	_
March	_
2003	_
charged	TARGET
that	_
Iran	_
may	_
have	_
taken	_
this	_
step	TARGET
.	_

Iran	_
responded	TARGET
by	_
strenuously	_
denying	TARGET
the	_
charges	_
,	_
but	_
also	_
maintained	TARGET
that	_
it	_
reserved	_
the	_
right	_
to	_
possess	TARGET
nuclear	_
weapons	TARGET
to	_
counter	_
Israel	_
's	_

An	_
Iranian	TARGET
initiative	_
to	_
normalize	_
relations	TARGET
was	_
communicated	TARGET
to	_
the	_
United	_

in	_
May	_
2003	_

It	_
includes	TARGET
a	_
promise	TARGET

To	_

the	_

pressure	TARGET
for	_

prompting	TARGET
a	_

In	_

that	_

At	_
the	_

Iran	_

remained	TARGET

through	_
the	_

continued	_

began	TARGET
a	_
see-saw	_
race	_
with	_
Iraq	_
for	_
superiority	_
in	_
these	_

This	_
race	_
would	_
last	_
throughout	_
the	_
eight	_

Iran	_

lost	TARGET
both	_

the	_

the	_

The	_

a	_
number	TARGET

factors	_

The	_
Soviet	_

was	_

By	_
the	_
end	TARGET
of	_

there	_
appears	TARGET

have	_
been	_
four	_
major	TARGET

indigenous	TARGET

production	TARGET

crude	_
artillery	_

the	_
indigenous	TARGET
design	TARGET

the	_
FROG-7A	_

the	_

and	_
the	_
reverse	_
engineering	_

production	TARGET
of	_
the	_
Scud-B.	_
The	_
greatest	_
obstacle	_
to	_
developing	TARGET
any	_
indigenous	TARGET

was	_
the	_
status	_

the	_
Ministry	_

infrastructure	TARGET

As	_
these	_
components	TARGET
developed	TARGET

Sometime	_

concluded	TARGET

worth	_

The	_

the	_
agreement	TARGET
are	_
unknown	_

however	_
,	_
it	_
is	_
estimated	TARGET
to	_
have	_
consisted	_
of	_
approximately	_
90	_

100	_
missiles	TARGET
and	_
an	_
estimated	TARGET
six	_
TELs	_

Within	_
Iran	_
,	_
the	_
Hwasong-5	_
was	_
designated	TARGET

Shehab-1	_
(	_
``	_
meteor	_
''	_
or	_
``	_
shooting	_
star	_
''	_
)	_
.	_

Upon	_
arrival	TARGET
the	_
missiles	_
were	_
assigned	_
to	_
the	_
Missile	_
Unit	_
of	_
the	_
IRGC	_
Air	_
Force	_
,	_
which	_
appears	TARGET
to	_
have	_
been	_
expanded	_
to	_
brigade	_
size	_
and	_
been	_
responsible	_
for	_
all	_
Scud	_
operations	TARGET
against	_
Iraq	_
.	_

In	_
1987	_
,	_
the	_
Missile	_
Unit	_
of	_
the	_
IRGC	_
Air	_
Force	_
fired	TARGET
18	_
Shehab-1	_
missiles	TARGET

increasing	TARGET
to	_
40	_
the	_
total	_
number	_
launched	TARGET
against	_
Iraq	_
to	_
date	_
.	_

This	_
probably	_
depleted	_
their	_
inventory	TARGET
of	_
missiles	TARGET
obtained	TARGET
from	_
Libya	_
and	_
Syria	_
.	_

Progress	TARGET
within	_
the	_
Shehab-1	_
program	TARGET
was	_
relatively	_
steady	_
and	_
during	_
early	TARGET
1988	_
,	_
Iranian	TARGET
officials	TARGET
claimed	TARGET
that	_
the	_
missile	TARGET

entered	TARGET

In	_
1988	_
,	_
Colonel	_
Rahimi	_
,	_
First	_
Deputy	_
Minister	_
of	_
Defense	_

stated	TARGET
``	_

''	_

This	_
320km	_
range	TARGET
is	_
the	_
range	TARGET
of	_
the	_
Shehab-1	_
(	_
i.e.	_
,	_
Hwasong-5	_
)	_
and	_
is	_
slightly	_
greater	_
than	_
the	_
280km	_
of	_
the	_
standard	_
Scud-B.	_
It	_
is	_
unlikely	TARGET
that	_
the	_
Iranians	_
manufactured	TARGET
these	_
missiles	TARGET

but	_
rather	_
they	_
were	_
assembled	TARGET
from	_
components	TARGET
provided	TARGET
by	_
the	_
DPRK	_

It	_
appears	TARGET
that	_
it	_
would	_
n't	_
be	_
until	_
the	_
early	TARGET
1990s	_
that	_
Iran	_
would	_
advance	TARGET
from	_
assembly	TARGET

In	_
the	_
early	TARGET
morning	TARGET

of	_
29	_
February	_
1988	_

Iran	_
--	_
in	_
its	_
largest	_
missile	TARGET
attack	TARGET
of	_
the	_
war	TARGET
to	_
date	_
--	_
launched	TARGET
three	_
Shehab-1s	_

This	_
attack	TARGET

in	_
response	TARGET

major	_
air	_
attack	TARGET
on	_
an	_
oil	TARGET

in	_
Tehran	_
two	_

Iraq	_
quickly	_
responded	TARGET

five	_

Iran	_
's	_
ability	TARGET

primarily	_
the	_
result	_

Sometime	_

As	_
a	_

Introduction	_

Iran	_
's	_
interest	TARGET
in	_
nuclear	_
technology	TARGET
dates	_
back	_
to	_
the	_
US	_
Atoms	_

Peace	_
program	TARGET
.	_

In	_
the	_
1950s	_
,	_
the	_
Shah	_
initiated	TARGET
Iran	_
's	_
nuclear	_
research	TARGET
program	TARGET
and	_
developed	TARGET
an	_
ambitious	_
plan	TARGET
to	_
produce	TARGET
23,000	_
MW	_
from	_
nuclear	_
power	TARGET
by	_
the	_
end	TARGET
of	_
the	_
century	TARGET
.	_

Early	TARGET
progress	TARGET
was	_
not	_
steady	_
,	_
and	_
the	_
nuclear	_
program	TARGET
was	_
stalled	_
by	_
the	_
Islamic	_
revolution	TARGET
in	_
1979	_
,	_
then	_
the	_
eight	_
-	_
year	TARGET
war	TARGET
with	_
Iraq	_
through	_
most	_
of	_
the	_
1980s	_
.	_

The	_
program	TARGET
was	_
revived	TARGET
later	TARGET
in	_
the	_
decade	TARGET
,	_
when	_
strategic	_
interests	TARGET
began	TARGET
to	_
drive	_
the	_
nuclear	_
program	TARGET
.	_

Under	_
the	_
Khomeini	_
regime	TARGET
,	_
Iran	_
's	_
nuclear	_
program	TARGET
steadily	_
grew	TARGET
on	_
all	_
fronts	_

the	_

with	_
a	_

screamed	TARGET

n't	_
we	_
teach	TARGET
our	_

to	_
read	TARGET

write	TARGET

It	_
's	_

that	_
we	_
do	_
n't	_

how	_

because	_
we	_
do	_

It	_
's	_
that	_
we	_
do	_
n't	_
want	TARGET
to	_
.	_

And	_
the	_
reason	TARGET
we	_
do	_
n't	_
want	TARGET
to	_
is	_
that	_
effective	TARGET
education	TARGET
would	_
require	TARGET
us	_
to	_
relinquish	TARGET
some	TARGET
cherished	_
metaphysical	_
beliefs	TARGET
about	TARGET
human	_
nature	_
in	_
general	_
and	_
the	_
human	TARGET
nature	_
of	_

in	_

,	_
as	_
well	_
as	_
to	_
violate	TARGET
some	TARGET
cherished	_
vested	_

These	_
beliefs	TARGET
so	_
dominate	TARGET
our	_
educational	TARGET
establishment	_
,	_
our	_
media	_
,	_
our	_
politicians	TARGET
,	_
and	_
even	_
our	_
parents	TARGET
that	_
it	_
seems	TARGET
almost	_
blasphemous	_
to	_
challenge	_
them	_
.	_

Here	_
is	_
an	_
example	TARGET
.	_

If	_
I	_
were	_
to	_
ask	TARGET
a	_
sample	_
of	_
American	TARGET
parents	TARGET
,	_
``	_
Do	_
you	_
wish	TARGET
the	_
elementary	_
schools	TARGET
to	_
encourage	TARGET
creativity	_
in	_
your	_
children	TARGET
?	_
''	_
the	_
near-unanimous	_
answer	TARGET
would	_
be	_
,	_
``	_
Yes	_
,	_
of	_
course	_

``	_
But	TARGET
what	_
do	_
we	_
mean	_
,	_
specifically	_
,	_
by	_
``	_
creativity	_
''	_
?	_

No	_
one	_
can	TARGET
say	TARGET
.	_

In	_
practice	_
,	_
it	_
ends	TARGET
up	_
being	_
equated	_
with	_
a	_
``	_
self-expression	_
''	_
that	_
encourages	TARGET
the	_
youngsters	TARGET
'	_
``	_
self-esteem	_
.	_

``	_
The	_
result	_
is	_
a	_
generation	_
of	_
young	TARGET
people	TARGET
whose	_
ignorance	TARGET
and	_
intellectual	_
incompetence	TARGET
is	_
matched	TARGET
only	_
by	_
their	_
good	TARGET
opinion	TARGET
of	_
themselves	_
.	_

The	_
whole	TARGET
notion	_
of	_
``	_
creativity	_
''	_
in	_
education	TARGET
was	_
(	_
and	_
is	_
)	_
part	_
and	_
parcel	_
of	_
a	_
romantic	_
rebellion	TARGET
against	_
disciplined	_

which	_
was	_
(	_
and	_
is	_

regarded	TARGET
as	_
``	_
authoritarian	TARGET

a	_
repression	_

the	_

It	_
is	_
not	_
surprising	TARGET
that	_
parents	TARGET
find	TARGET
this	_
romantic	_
extravagance	_
so	_
attractive	_
.	_

Fortunately	TARGET
,	_
these	_
same	TARGET
parents	TARGET
do	_
want	TARGET
their	_
children	TARGET
to	_
get	TARGET
a	_
decent	TARGET

,	_
and	_
they	_
have	TARGET
enough	TARGET
common	_
sense	_
to	_
know	TARGET
what	_
that	_
demands	TARGET

Their	_
commitment	TARGET

fight	TARGET
against	_

CHEMICAL	_
PROGRAM	TARGET

Iran	_
has	_
had	TARGET
a	_
chemical	_
weapons	TARGET
production	TARGET
program	TARGET
since	_
early	_
in	_
the	_
Iran	_

Iraq	_
war	TARGET

It	_
used	TARGET
chemical	_

to	_
respond	TARGET
to	_
Iraqi	_
chemical	_
attacks	TARGET
on	_
several	_
occasions	_
during	_
that	_
war	TARGET

Since	_
the	_
early	_
1990s	_
,	_
it	_
has	_
put	_
a	_
high	TARGET
priority	_
on	_
its	_
chemical	_
weapons	TARGET
program	TARGET
because	_
of	_
its	_
inability	_
to	_
respond	TARGET
in	_
kind	_
to	_
Iraq	_
's	_
chemical	TARGET
attacks	TARGET
and	_
the	_
discovery	TARGET
of	_
substantial	_
Iraqi	_
efforts	TARGET
with	_
advanced	_
agents	TARGET
,	_
such	_
as	_
the	_
highly	_
persistent	_
nerve	_
agent	TARGET
VX	_
.	_

Iran	_
ratified	TARGET
the	_
CWC	_
,	_
under	_
which	_
it	_
will	_
be	_
obligated	TARGET
to	_
eliminate	TARGET
its	_
chemical	TARGET
program	TARGET
over	_
a	_
period	_
of	_
years	TARGET

Nevertheless	_
,	_
it	_
continues	TARGET
to	_
upgrade	_
and	_
expand	_
its	_
chemical	TARGET
warfare	TARGET
production	TARGET
infrastructure	TARGET
and	_
munitions	_
arsenal	TARGET

Iran	_
manufactures	TARGET
weapons	TARGET
for	_
blister	_
,	_
blood	_
,	_
and	_
choking	_
agents	TARGET
;	_
it	_
is	_
also	_
believed	TARGET
to	_
be	_
conducting	_
research	TARGET
on	_
nerve	_
agents	TARGET
.	_

Iran	_
has	TARGET
a	_
stockpile	_
of	_
these	_
weapons	TARGET
,	_
including	TARGET
artillery	_

bombs	TARGET
,	_
which	_
could	_
be	_
used	TARGET
in	_
another	TARGET
conflict	TARGET
in	_
the	_
region	TARGET

Although	_
Iran	_

production	TARGET
capability	TARGET
for	_
all	_
aspects	_

BIOLOGICAL	_
PROGRAM	TARGET

Iran	_
's	_
biological	_
warfare	TARGET
program	TARGET
began	TARGET
during	_
the	_
Iran	_
-	_
Iraq	_
war	TARGET
.	_

The	_
pace	_
of	_
the	_
program	TARGET
probably	_
has	_
increased	TARGET
because	_
of	_
the	_
1995	_
revelations	TARGET
about	_
the	_
scale	_
of	_
Iraqi	_
efforts	TARGET
prior	_
to	_
the	_

War	_

Later	_
in	_

Natanz	_
,	_
which	_
is	_

learned	TARGET
that	_

the	_
capability	TARGET

During	_
the	_
IAEA	_

Iranian	_
officials	TARGET
indicated	TARGET
that	_
Iran	_

honor	_

the	_
IAEA	_

willingness	_

any	_

In	_
October	_
1991	_

the	_
Iranian	_
vice	_
president	_
said	TARGET
that	_
if	_
Israel	_

atomic	_
bombs	TARGET
then	_
Muslims	_
should	_
collectively	_
develop	TARGET
their	_

After	_
Ayatollah	_

1979	_
he	_
canceled	_
Iran	_

In	_
1974	_

expired	_
in	_
1990	_
