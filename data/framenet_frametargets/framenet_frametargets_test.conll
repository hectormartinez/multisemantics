Your	_

there	_

a	_

The	_
rest	_
of	_

goes	_
on	_

the	_

Only	_
35	_

is	_
perfect	_
for	_
swimming	_

only	_
about	_
12,000	_
;	_
it	_
is	_
still	_
largely	_
undeveloped	_

and	_
life	_
on	_
Lamma	_
,	_
if	_

is	_
close	_

the	_
essentials	_

Archaeologists	_
indicate	_
that	_
Lamma	_
has	_
probably	_
been	_
inhabited	_
for	_
some	_
4,000	_
years	_

An	_
Excursion	_
to	_
Macau	_

Macau	_
,	_
the	_
final	_
bastion	_
of	_
Portugal	_
's	_
great	_
16th	_
-	_
century	_
empire	_
,	_
is	_
much	_
more	_
than	_
just	_
a	_
quirk	_
of	_
history	_
.	_

Here	_
,	_
where	_
East	_
and	_
West	_
first	_
met	_
,	_
life	_
combines	_
the	_
spirit	_
of	_
Asia	_
with	_
something	_
of	_
the	_
sunny	_
atmosphere	_
of	_
the	_
Mediterranean	_
.	_

Macau	_
's	_
historic	_
center	_
,	_
with	_
its	_
colonial	_
architecture	_
,	_
has	_
a	_
distinctly	_
Mediterranean	_
flavor	_
.	_

Colonnaded	_
public	_
buildings	_
,	_
iron	_
balconies	_
,	_
winding	_
streets	_
,	_
flagstoned	_
squares	_
and	_
the	_
many	_
churches	_
all	_
speak	_
of	_
the	_
Portuguese	_
inheritance	_
as	_
well	_
as	_
the	_
Chinese	_
,	_
a	_
fusion	_
of	_
East	_
and	_
West	_
that	_
has	_
produced	_
the	_
unique	_
Macanese	_
culture	_
.	_

The	_
story	_
of	_
the	_
Western	_
discovery	_
of	_
Macau	_
begins	_
in	_
1513	_
when	_
Portuguese	_
explorer	_
,	_
Jorge	_
Alvares	_
,	_
reached	_
the	_
south	_
coast	_
of	_
China	_
.	_

Traders	_
followed	_
in	_
his	_
wake	_
,	_
setting	_
up	_
bases	_
in	_
several	_
parts	_
of	_
the	_
Pearl	_
River	_
estuary	_
.	_

Finally	_
,	_
in	_
1557	_
,	_
they	_
were	_
all	_
consolidated	_
in	_
Macau	_
.	_

It	_
was	_
the	_
only	_
European	_
gateway	_
to	_
China	_
,	_
and	_
through	_
Macau	_
flowed	_
Western	_
technology	_
and	_
religion	_
.	_

In	_
1576	_
Pope	_
Gregory	_
XIII	_
created	_
the	_
Macau	_
diocese	_
,	_
covering	_
all	_
of	_
China	_
and	_
Japan	_
.	_

No	_
less	_
impressive	_
were	_
the	_
secular	_
challenges	_
.	_

China	_
and	_
Japan	_
were	_
not	_
on	_
speaking	_
terms	_
,	_
so	_
trade	_
between	_
them	_
had	_
to	_
be	_
channeled	_
through	_
a	_
neutral	_
middleman	_
.	_

Lucky	_
Macau	_
fit	_
the	_
specifications	_
exactly	_
.	_

Portugal	_
's	_
resulting	_
near	_
-	_
monopoly	_
of	_
East	_
-	_
West	_
trade	_
understandably	_
awakened	_
the	_
competitive	_
instincts	_
of	_
other	_
European	_
powers	_
.	_

The	_
Dutch	_
sent	_
an	_
invasion	_
flotilla	_
to	_
Macau	_
in	_
1622	_
,	_
but	_
the	_
defenders	_
triumphed	_
.	_

However	_
,	_
the	_
end	_
of	_
the	_
golden	_
age	_
was	_
drawing	_
near	_
.	_

China	_
began	_
to	_
relax	_
trade	_
restrictions	_
,	_
and	_
with	_
the	_
rise	_
of	_
Hong	_
Kong	_
,	_
Macau	_
became	_
an	_
isolated	_
Portuguese	_
outpost	_
.	_

A	_
haven	_
for	_
persecuted	_
Japanese	_
Christians	_
in	_
the	_
17th	_
century	_
,	_
Portugal	_
's	_
neutrality	_
during	_
World	_
War	_
II	_
assured	_
the	_
territory	_
a	_
flood	_
of	_
refugees	_
.	_

They	_
were	_
joined	_
by	_
a	_
swarm	_
of	_
spies	_
of	_
all	_
conceivable	_
nationalities	_
,	_
and	_
Macau	_
won	_
a	_
name	_
for	_
international	_
intrigue	_
.	_

Portugal	_
's	_
very	_
precarious	_
foothold	_
on	_
the	_
Asian	_
coast	_
ended	_
in	_
1999	_
with	_
a	_
formal	_
handover	_
to	_
China	_
.	_

Macau	_
,	_
now	_
the	_
Chinese	_
Special	_
Economic	_
Zone	_
of	_
Zhuhai	_
,	_
is	_
becoming	_
something	_
like	_
a	_
boomtown	_
as	_
an	_
exporter	_
of	_
toys	_
,	_
furniture	_
,	_
and	_
electronics	_
.	_

New	_
construction	_
in	_
the	_
past	_
10	_

skyline	_
;	_
with	_
new	_
,	_
glittering	_
hotels	_
and	_
highrise	_
apartment	_
blocks	_
,	_
the	_
city	_
is	_
beginning	_
to	_
look	_
a	_
little	_
more	_
like	_
Hong	_
Kong	_
.	_

Macau	_
's	_
population	_
is	_
estimated	_
at	_
around	_
450,000	_
,	_
an	_
appallingly	_
high	_
figure	_
for	_
such	_
a	_
small	_
area	_
;	_
recent	_
land	_
reclamation	_
has	_
eased	_
the	_
situation	_
to	_
some	_
extent	_
.	_

If	_
a	_
trace	_
of	_
tropical	_
lethargy	_
still	_
adds	_
to	_
the	_
charm	_
in	_
this	_
city	_
of	_
sidewalk	_
cafes	_
,	_
palm	_
trees	_
,	_
and	_
pedicabs	_

any	_

of	_
some	_
of	_
the	_
liveliest	_
gambling	_

provides	_
almost	_
40	_
percent	_
of	_
the	_

Guangzhou	_

China	_

major	_
seaport	_

2,000	_
years	_

the	_
center	_
for	_

traders	_
in	_

the	_
Canton	_
Trade	_
Fair	_
(	_
officially	_

which	_
links	_
the	_
city	_
to	_
the	_
South	_
China	_
Sea	_

This	_
waterway	_
accounts	_
for	_
much	_
of	_
the	_
local	_
charm	_
and	_
excitement	_
,	_
as	_
the	_
daily	_
drama	_
of	_
the	_
ferryboats	_
,	_
junks	_
,	_

and	_
even	_

-	_
unfolds	_
right	_
in	_
the	_
center	_

The	_
river	_
also	_
irrigates	_
the	_
carefully	_
tended	_
surrounding	_

a	_
beautifully	_

has	_
some	_
of	_
China	_

,	_
along	_
with	_
vegetables	_
of	_
all	_
kinds	_

Guangzhou	_

determinedly	_
on	_
the	_
move	_

It	_
seems	_
that	_
the	_
picturesque	_
older	_
sections	_
with	_
their	_
old	_
houses	_
,	_
narrow	_
streets	_

An	_
Excursion	_
to	_
Shenzhen	_

Shenzhen	_
was	_
China	_
's	_
first	_
Special	_
Economic	_
Zone	_
.	_

Literally	_
created	_
out	_
of	_
rural	_
farmland	_
,	_
it	_
was	_
set	_
up	_
in	_
the	_
1970s	_
as	_
the	_
answer	_
to	_
Hong	_
Kong	_
.	_

From	_
a	_
population	_
of	_
20,000	_
it	_
has	_
grown	_
into	_
a	_
metropolis	_
of	_
2.5	_
million	_
,	_
with	_
tightly	_
clustered	_
skyscrapers	_
and	_
some	_
of	_
China	_
's	_
highest	_
grossing	_
industries	_
.	_

Because	_
Shenzhen	_
is	_
much	_
cheaper	_
than	_
Hong	_
Kong	_
,	_
it	_
is	_
a	_
popular	_
weekend	_
destination	_
for	_
Hong	_

's	_
Chinese	_
,	_
who	_
come	_
to	_

golf	_
-	_
Shenzhen	_
hosted	_
the	_
World	_
Cup	_
of	_
Golf	_
in	_
1995	_
.	_

It	_
is	_
even	_
becoming	_
something	_
of	_
a	_
commuter	_
town	_
-	_
owning	_
or	_
renting	_
an	_
apartment	_
here	_
costs	_
a	_

of	_
what	_
it	_
would	_
in	_
Hong	_

Shenzhen	_

the	_

taking	_
about	_
40	_
minutes	_

need	_

only	_
for	_
his	_

regime	TARGET
an	_
apostate	_
if	_
it	_
has	_

adhered	TARGET
to	_

.	_

Well	_
,	_
this	_
is	_
not	_
the	_
case	_
.	_

If	_
,	_
you	_
study	TARGET
the	_
evidences	_
and	_
statements	TARGET
released	TARGET
by	_
these	_
people	TARGET
,	_
we	_
tend	TARGET
to	_
appreciate	TARGET
their	_
ignorance	TARGET
which	_
was	_
based	_
on	_
prominent	TARGET
views	TARGET
.	_

We	_
had	_
done	TARGET
that	_
before	_
with	_
others	_
who	_
were	_
known	_
for	_
their	_
serious	TARGET
blunders	_
.	_

I	_
'm	_
not	_
going	_
to	_

these	_
evidences	_
and	_
statements	TARGET
;	_
God	_
is	_
my	_
witness	_
,	_
I	_
do	_
n't	_
want	TARGET
to	_
deceive	TARGET
anyone	_
.	_

However	_
,	_
I	_
will	_
mention	TARGET
one	TARGET
of	_
these	_
evidences	_
reiterated	TARGET
by	_
them	_
.	_

Indeed	_
,	_
the	_
Sheik	TARGET
issued	TARGET
two	TARGET
edicts	_
regarding	TARGET
the	_
same	TARGET
issue	TARGET
that	_
contradict	TARGET
each	_
other	_
...	_

First	_
,	_
he	_
forbade	_
seeking	TARGET
the	_
aid	TARGET
of	_
infidels	_
when	_
the	_
Syrian	TARGET
Mujahiddin	_
asked	TARGET
Saddam	_
Hussein	_
to	_
overthrow	TARGET
the	_
regime	TARGET
of	_
Hafiz	_
Al-Assad	_
in	TARGET
Syria	_
.	_

However	_
,	_
he	_
allowed	TARGET
the	_
Gulf	_
regimes	TARGET
to	_
depend	TARGET
on	_
the	_
infidels	_
in	_
attacking	TARGET
Saddam	_
Hussein	_
.	_

[	_
He	_
issued	TARGET
]	_
more	TARGET
edicts	_
to	_
accommodate	_
the	_
policies	TARGET
of	_
the	_
Saudi	_
regime	TARGET
.	_

This	_
behavior	TARGET
and	_
not	_
the	_
edict	_
itself	_
forced	_
them	_
to	_
be	_
deceptive	TARGET
.	_

I	_
am	_
sure	TARGET
that	_
you	_
are	_
aware	TARGET
of	_
all	TARGET
these	_
suspicions	TARGET
that	_
surround	_
the	_
regime	TARGET
's	_
[	_
Religious	_

scholars	_

So	_
,	_
try	TARGET
to	_
appreciate	TARGET
the	_
Muslims	TARGET
'	_
position	_
,	_
especially	_
if	_
these	_
suspicions	TARGET

credible	_

MERCYFUL	_

So	_
this	_
is	_
the	_
reality	_
we	_
're	_
living	TARGET
in	TARGET
al-Anbar	_
in	_
general	_
,	_
and	_
Ramadi	_
in	_
particular	_
,	_
that	_
is	_
the	_
head	_
Sheiks	_
of	_
some	TARGET
tribes	TARGET
,	_
and	_
symbols	_
of	_
the	_
Islamic	_
Party	TARGET
,	_
sat	TARGET
with	TARGET
the	_
Americans	TARGET
in	_
Jordan	_
,	_
and	_
other	TARGET
places	TARGET
,	_
to	_
fight	TARGET
terrorism	TARGET
and	_
its	_
people	TARGET
.	_

The	_
Sheiks	_
started	TARGET
teaching	TARGET
people	TARGET
about	TARGET
these	_
ideas	_
.	_

This	_
conspiracy	TARGET
is	_
led	TARGET
by	_
two	TARGET
sides	TARGET
.	_

The	_
first	TARGET
is	_
the	_
heads	TARGET
of	_
the	_
tribes	TARGET
.	_

The	_
second	TARGET
is	_
the	_
leaders	TARGET
of	_
the	_
Islamic	_
Party	TARGET
and	_
mosques	TARGET
speakers	_
.	_

So	_
they	_
announced	TARGET
their	_
war	TARGET
on	_
the	_
Mujahidin	_
.	_

It	_
increased	TARGET
during	_
the	_
elections	TARGET
for	_
the	_
new	TARGET
constitution	_
.	_

Their	_
danger	TARGET
was	_
so	_
great	_
,	_
that	_
hundreds	TARGET
of	_
people	TARGET
volunteered	TARGET
in	_
the	_
police	_
and	_
the	_
army	TARGET
,	_
and	_
thousands	TARGET
of	_
people	TARGET
participated	TARGET
in	_
the	_
elections	TARGET
,	_
renouncing	TARGET
their	_
religion	_
,	_
and	_
listenning	_
to	_
the	_
erratics	_
.	_

After	_
we	_
took	_
a	_
look	_
at	_
the	_
situation	_
,	_
we	_
found	_
that	_
the	_
best	_
solutions	_
to	_
stop	_
thousands	_
of	_
people	_
from	_
renouncing	_
their	_
religion	_
,	_
is	_
to	_
cut	_
the	_
heads	_
of	_
the	_
Sheiks	_
of	_
infidelity	_
and	_
erratic	_
.	_

Before	_
we	_
start	_
reviewing	_
the	_
events	_
that	_
accured	_
here	_
,	_
we	_
ask	_
two	_
questions:	_

First	TARGET
:	_
If	_
there	_
were	TARGET
people	TARGET
who	_
are	_
raping	TARGET
thousands	TARGET
of	_
Muslim	_
women	TARGET
taking	TARGET
their	_
honor	_
,	_
and	_
stealing	TARGET
muslim	_
money	TARGET
and	_
land	_
,	_
and	_
other	TARGET
people	TARGET
who	_
do	_
n't	_
rape	TARGET
or	_
steal	TARGET
,	_
but	_
they	_
take	TARGET
the	_
religion	_
away	_
from	_
thousands	TARGET
of	_
Muslims	TARGET
,	_
what	_
's	_
more	TARGET
important	TARGET
,	_
religion	_
,	_
or	_
honor	_
and	_
land	_
?	_

What	_
we	_
learned	TARGET
from	_
Muslim	_
scholars	_
is	_
that	_
robbing	TARGET
the	_
religion	_
from	_
Muslims	TARGET
,	_
is	_
greater	_
than	_
robbing	TARGET
their	_
honor	_
and	_
land	_
.	_

God	_
said	TARGET
``	_
turmoil	_
is	_
greater	_
than	_
murder	TARGET
''	_
,	_
and	_
for	_
those	_
devils	_
,	_
their	_
danger	TARGET
is	_
greater	_
than	_
who	_
rapes	TARGET
,	_
or	_
rob	TARGET
and	_
steal	TARGET
money	TARGET
or	_
land	_
.	_

Second	_
question	_
:	_
Why	_
did	_
we	_
announce	_
and	_
started	_
fighting	_
the	_
Shiites	_
and	_
police	_
from	_
the	_
start	_
,	_
even	_
though	_
most	_
of	_
the	_
Jihadist	_
sectors	_
and	_
the	_
public	_
did	_
n't	_
understand	_
what	_
we	_
want	_
,	_
and	_
did	_
n't	_
know	_
the	_
importance	_
of	_
starting	_
with	_
those	_
?	_

So	_
what	_
's	_
the	_
objection	_
on	_
killing	_
and	_
executing	_
the	_
Sheiks	_
now	_
and	_
without	_
a	_
notice	_
,	_
with	_
continiuing	_
making	_
people	_
understand	_
it	_
,	_
just	_
like	_
we	_
did	_
by	_
killing	_
the	_
police	_
then	_
?	_

Were	_
people	_
satisfied	_
with	_
us	_
?	_

Actually	_
lot	_
of	_
the	_
public	_
thinks	_
that	_
who	_
killed	_
the	_
police	_
is	_
Badr	_
organization	_
or	_
gangs	_
from	_
Iran	_
!	_

And	_
that	_
who	_
's	_
killing	_
Shiites	_
is	_
hired	_
by	_
Israel	_
and	_
the	_
U.S.	_
to	_
start	_
an	_
ethnic	_
war	_
and	_
so	_
on	_
.	_

From	_
what	_
we	_
saw	TARGET
,	_
the	_
damage	TARGET
caused	TARGET
by	_
those	_
erratic	_
infidels	_
(	_
Tribes	_
Sheiks	_
,	_
The	_
Islamic	_
Party	_
)	_
is	_
more	TARGET
dangerous	TARGET
than	_
the	_
Shiites	_
and	_
the	_
peaceful	_
police	_
as	_
people	TARGET
call	_
them	_
.	_

You	_
Sheik	TARGET
announced	TARGET
war	TARGET
on	_
those	_
,	_
with	_
the	_
opposings	_
of	_
many	TARGET
sectors	TARGET
and	_
scholars	_
of	_
decision	TARGET
making	TARGET
.	_

The	_
brothers	TARGET
now	TARGET
are	_
wiping	_
out	_
the	_
heads	TARGET
of	_
infidelity	_
,	_
as	_
soon	_
as	_
they	_
started	TARGET
,	_
and	_
never	TARGET
claiming	TARGET
responsibility	TARGET
,	_
we	_
found	TARGET
among	_
us	_
who	_
wants	TARGET
to	_
make	_
fuss	_
about	TARGET
it	_
,	_
and	_
regretfully	_
some	TARGET
of	_
the	_
brothers	TARGET
with	_
us	_
in	_
the	_
organization	TARGET
(	_
al-Qa'ida	_
)	_
see	TARGET
it	_
as	_
nonsense	_
,	_
and	_
God	_
is	_
my	_
witness	_
.	_

My	_
Sheik	TARGET
,	_
here	_
's	_
some	TARGET
of	_
the	_
events	TARGET
that	_
happened	TARGET
in	_
Ramadi	_
:	_

1-	_
Sheik	TARGET
Nasr	_
al-Fahdawi	_
,	_
Sheik	TARGET
of	_
AlbuFahd	_
tribe	TARGET
,	_
was	_
nominated	_
to	_
be	_
the	_
governor	TARGET
of	_
Anbar	_
,	_
this	_
man	TARGET
worked	TARGET
so	_
hard	_
fighting	TARGET
the	_
(	_
Tanzim	_
)	_
organization	TARGET
,	_
with	_
all	_
he	_
's	_
got	TARGET
,	_
from	_
money	TARGET
to	_
power	TARGET
,	_
and	_
reputation	_
in	_
Ramadi	_
.	_

So	_
we	_
tried	TARGET
this	_
with	_
him	_
:	_
First	TARGET
,	_
we	_
backed	_
off	_
during	_
the	_
elections	TARGET
.	_

They	_
had	TARGET
checkpoints	_
.	_

Utens	_
of	_
his	_
tribesmen	_
who	_
started	TARGET
checking	TARGET
cars	TARGET
,	_
they	_
violated	_
our	_
brothers	TARGET
many	TARGET
times	_
.	_

They	_
even	_
announced	TARGET
it	_
,	_
then	_
our	_
brothers	TARGET
attacked	TARGET
the	_
field	_
leader	TARGET
,	_
the	_
brain	_
behind	_
people	TARGET
revolting	TARGET
at	TARGET
al-Anbar	_
in	TARGET
AlbuFahd	_
.	_

So	_
the	_
brothers	TARGET
raided	TARGET
his	_
house	TARGET
in	_
the	_
middle	TARGET
of	_
the	_
night	TARGET
wearing	TARGET
the	_
national	_
guards	_
uniform	TARGET
and	_
driving	TARGET
similar	TARGET
cars	TARGET
.	_

They	_
took	TARGET
him	_
and	_
killed	TARGET
him	_
.	_

Thank	TARGET
God	_
.	_

The	_
next	TARGET
morning	TARGET
his	_
households	_
and	_
neighbors	TARGET
started	TARGET
talking	TARGET
to	_
the	_
tribe	TARGET
saying	TARGET
it	_
was	_
the	_
national	TARGET
guards	_
,	_
they	_
added	TARGET
that	_
they	_
heard	TARGET
some	TARGET
of	_
them	_
speaking	TARGET
English	_
,	_
meaning	_
that	_
the	_
Americans	TARGET
are	_
the	_
ones	_
who	_
took	TARGET
Abu	_
Dhari	_
(	_
Sheik	_
Nasr	_
al-Fahdawi	_
)	_
.	_

No	TARGET
one	TARGET
claimed	TARGET
responsibility	TARGET
for	_
his	_
killing	TARGET
.	_

Thank	TARGET
God	_
.	_

2-	_
Around	TARGET
the	_
same	TARGET
period	TARGET
,	_
our	_
brothers	TARGET
on	_
the	_
other	TARGET
side	TARGET
of	_
Uphrate	_
river	TARGET
,	_
killed	TARGET
Jasim	_
al-`Awwad	_
in	TARGET
al-Malahima	_
and	_
AlbuHazim	_
.	_

He	_
's	_
considered	TARGET
as	_
important	TARGET
as	_
Abu	_
Dhari	_
in	TARGET
AlbuFahd	_
.	_

He	_
's	_
a	_
big	_
spy	_
/	_
agent	_
,	_
invited	TARGET
Americans	TARGET
to	_
his	_
house	TARGET
for	_
big	_
dinner	_
parties	TARGET
many	TARGET
times	_
,	_
regardless	_
,	_
our	_
brothers	TARGET
did	_
n't	_
claim	TARGET
resposibility	_
for	_
killing	_
him	_
.	_

3-	_
After	_
our	_
brothers	_
killed	_
three	_
of	_
the	_
infidels	_
in	_
AlbuFahd	_
,	_
some	_
of	_
them	_
claimed	_
he	_
's	_
for	_
Jihad	_
,	_
at	_
the	_
same	_
time	_
,	_
protects	_
with	_
his	_
soldiers	_
the	_
election	_
centers	_
,	_
and	_
encourages	_
people	_
to	_
volunteers	_
in	_
the	_
police	_
force	_
and	_
the	_
Iraqi	_
army	_
,	_
and	_
it	_
was	_
the	_
second	_
hit	_
for	_
Nasr	_
al-Fahdawi	_
.	_

In	_
the	_
morning	_
infidels	_
announced	_
in	_
their	_
satellite	_
channels	_
that	_
Nasr	_
al-Fahdawi	_
welcomed	_
Ibrahim	_
al-Ja'fari	_
in	_
Ramadi	_
,	_
then	_
by	_
noon	_
,	_
they	_
announced	_
his	_
assasination	_
.	_

Thank	_
God	_
.	_

Then	_
there	_
was	_
a	_
complete	_
change	_
of	_
events	_
than	_
is	_
was	_
before	_
.	_

Thank	_
God	_
.	_

Cousins	_
of	_
Sheik	_
Nasr	_
came	_
to	_
the	_
Mujahidin	_
begging	_
,	_
announcing	_
their	_
repentance	_
and	_
innocense	_
,	_
saying	_

No	_

The	_

with	_

the	_
Sheik	TARGET
of	_
AlbuJlayb	_

and	_

al-Anbar	_

released	TARGET

markets	_

promising	TARGET
to	_
eliminate	TARGET
who	_
he	_
called	TARGET
Sheiks	_
of	_
sodomite	_
and	_
thift	_
,	_
and	_
agents	_
for	_
the	_
Zionists	_
,	_
like	_
our	_
brother	_
Abu	_
Mustafa	_
Midhatt	_
,	_
our	_
brother	_
Abu	_
Khattab	_
,	_
and	_
Sheik	_
Abu	_
al-Harith	_
al-Shar'i	_
,	_
and	_
many	_
others	_
.	_

This	_
vicious	_
organization	_
(	_
al-Anbar	_
revolutionists	_
)	_
attempted	_
to	_
assasinate	_
our	_
brother	_
Abu	_
Khudayr	_
,	_
in	_
Ramadi	_
.	_

When	_
armed	_
men	_
shot	_
him	_
,	_
was	_
injured	_
in	_
the	_
thigh	_
.	_

Sheik	_
Muhammad	_
Saddak	_
said	_
himself	_
that	_
he	_
's	_
nominated	_
for	_
the	_
position	_
of	_
the	_
interior	_
minister	_
,	_
and	_
Sheik	_
Nasr	_
al-Fahdawi	_
for	_
the	_
governor	_
of	_
Anbar	_
,	_
like	_
the	_
Americans	_
promised	_
him	_
,	_
and	_
Abu	_
Raghghal	_
al-Dulaymi	_
and	_
others	_
.	_

Thank	_
God	_
.	_

His	_
was	_
eliminated	_
by	_
the	_
brothers	_
inside	_
the	_
city	_
of	_
Baghdad	_
.	_

Until	_
now	_
no	_
one	_
knows	_
who	_
killed	_
him	_
in	_
Baghdad	_
.	_

With	_
all	_
that	_
,	_
our	_
policy	_
is	_
to	_
eliminate	_
the	_
heads	_
of	_
infidelity	_
without	_
any	_
announcements	_
.	_

As	_
for	_
the	_
heads	_
of	_
the	_
Islamic	_
Party	_
,	_
our	_
brothers	_
been	_
monitoring	_
them	_
for	_
so	_
long	_
,	_
but	_
ignored	_
them	_
during	_
the	_
elections	_
.	_

Then	_
their	_
vicious	_
role	_
appeared	_
,	_
with	_
their	_
call	_
to	_
form	_
police	_
and	_
army	_
after	_
the	_
elections	_
.	_

We	_
found	_
that	_
the	_
main	_
thinker	_
behind	_
the	_
Party	_
's	_
ideas	_
is	_
Sheik	_
Abd	_
al-Ghafur	_
al-Kubaysi	_
the	_
Imam	_
and	_
speaker	_
-	_
of	_
-	_
of	_
al-Shafi	_
'i	_
mosque	_
in	_
Ramadi	_
,	_
and	_
made	_
his	_
mosque	_
the	_
center	_
of	_
all	_
the	_
Party	_
's	_
meetings	_
.	_

With	_
all	_
that	_
,	_
he	_
did	_
n't	_
stop	_
fighting	_
the	_
brothers	_
with	_
his	_
speeches	_
at	_
the	_
mosque	_
,	_
so	_
the	_
brothers	_
assasinated	_
him	_
near	_
his	_
house	_
,	_
after	_
he	_
left	_
the	_
mosque	_
going	_
home	_
.	_

And	_
there	_
was	_
no	_
reaction	_
by	_
the	_
Islamic	_
Party	_
or	_
people	_
,	_
except	_
that	_
they	_
raised	_
signs	_
condemning	_
the	_
killing	_
.	_

The	_
same	_
thing	_
exactly	_
happened	_
after	_
the	_
killing	_
of	_
Abu	_
Bilal	_
in	_
Ramadi	_
.	_

The	_
manager	_
of	_
the	_
media	_
office	_
at	_
the	_
Islamic	_
Party	_
as	_
it	_
was	_
announced	_
in	_
some	_
media	_
sources	_
,	_
he	_
disallowed	_
and	_
torn	_
any	_
Jihad	_
related	_
posters	_
on	_
the	_
walls	_
.	_

He	_
was	_
caught	_
in	_
the	_
act	_
by	_
the	_
brothers	_
.	_

They	_
beat	_
him	_
and	_
arrested	_
him	_
.	_

He	_
routed	_
out	_
lots	_
of	_
the	_
Party	_
's	_
leaders	_
,	_
like	_
Abd	_
al-Ghafur	_
al-Kubaysi	_
,	_
and	_
their	_
conspiracies	_
against	_
the	_
Tanzim	_
(	_
al-Qa'ida	_
organization	_
)	_
.	_

He	_
was	_
ill	_
,	_
got	_
transferred	_
to	_
a	_
hospital	_
where	_
he	_
later	_
died	_
.	_

There	_
were	_
no	_
puplicity	_
to	_
his	_
death	_
by	_
people	_
,	_
expect	_
condemning	_
it	_
by	_
the	_
corrupted	_
satellite	_
channels	_
.	_

We	_
did	_
not	_
follow	_
this	_
policy	_
until	_
we	_
ran	_
out	_
of	_
time	_
,	_
from	_
past	_
experience	_
where	_
we	_
let	_
things	_
go	_
,	_
like	_
Kataib	_
al-Hamza	_
(	_
Hamza	_
brigades	_
)	_
,	_
and	_
AlbuMahal	_
tribe	_
in	_
al-Qaim	_
,	_
where	_
we	_
should	_
've	_
eliminated	_
them	_
then	_
,	_
but	_
what	_
happened	_
happened	_
,	_
also	_
Muhsin	_
Abd	_
al-Hamid	_
etc	_
...	_
And	_
you	_
Sheik	_
said	_
that	_
yourself	_
God	_
bless	_
you	_
.	_

Also	_
in	_
Fallujah	_
where	_
brothers	_
neglected	_
on	_
killing	_
the	_
heads	_
of	_
infidelity	_
,	_
and	_
what	_
happened	_
also	_
happened	_
.	_

Now	_
we	_
have	_
Kabisah	_
.	_

This	_
small	_
village	_
announced	_
this	_
week	_
that	_
130	_
policemen	_
volunteered	_
from	_
there	_
.	_

Next	_
day	_
they	_
started	_
working	_
.	_

It	_
was	_
secretly	_
prepared	_
from	_
before	_
,	_
and	_
the	_
Islamic	_
Party	_
was	_
behind	_
recruiting	_
those	_
policemen	_
,	_
like	_
we	_
proved	_
.	_

Our	_
state	_
council	_
forbids	_
from	_
targeting	_
Sunni	_
police	_
,	_
or	_
killing	_
and	_
eliminating	_
the	_
infidels	_
and	_
traitors	_
without	_
going	_
back	_
to	_
the	_
council	_
,	_
and	_
you	_
know	_
that	_
assasinations	_
are	_
about	_
good	_
opportunities	_
,	_
and	_
monitoring	_
a	_
person	_
could	_
take	_
days	_
or	_
weeks	_
.	_

The	_
best	_
solution	_
is	_
to	_
cut	_
the	_
head	_
of	_
the	_
snake	_
.	_

We	_
say	_
that	_
the	_
brothers	_
are	_
following	_
this	_
method	_
.	_

That	_
's	_
what	_
we	_
learned	_
from	_
you	_
and	_
promised	_
you	_
,	_
I	_
said	_
that	_
this	_
is	_
Abu	_
Bakr	_
's	_
period	_
.	_

Toughness	_
toughness	_
.	_

We	_
in	_
Iraq	_
will	_
defend	_
the	_
muslim	_
nation	_
,	_
and	_
Jihad	_
is	_
everybody	_
's	_
responsibility	_
.	_

Do	_
n't	_
miss	_
it	_
.	_

Other	_
groups	_
pretends	_
that	_
they	_
never	_
killed	_
an	_
Iraqi	_
or	_
Sunni	_
in	_
particular	_
,	_
and	_
that	_
its	_
goals	_
are	_
patriotic	_
.	_

What	_
we	_
know	_
about	_
our	_
Jihad	_
,	_
that	_
it	_
's	_
Jihad	_
of	_
faith	_
,	_
and	_
what	_
you	_
stated	_
over	_
and	_
over	_
before	_
my	_
Sheik	_
about	_
the	_
method	_
of	_
the	_
group	_
,	_
and	_
the	_
honorable	_
resistance	_
in	_
many	_
of	_
the	_
speeches	_
to	_
our	_
brothers	_
and	_
people	_
.	_

In	_
fact	_
Sheik	_
we	_
are	_
joyous	_
for	_
forming	_
the	_
state	_
council	_
,	_
although	_
we	_
say	_
,	_
to	_
save	_
this	_
blessed	_
work	_
,	_
which	_
we	_
pray	_
to	_
God	_
that	_
Islam	_
and	_
Muslims	_
would	_
benefit	_
from	_
it	_
,	_
everyone	_
should	_
agree	_
on	_
our	_
policy	_
in	_
the	_
war	_
against	_
the	_
renegade	_
,	_
without	_
these	_
restrictions	_
we	_
have	_
at	_
the	_
state	_
council	_
.	_

We	_
have	_
no	_
problem	_
with	_
you	_
saying	_
for	_
us	_
to	_
give	_
the	_
name	_
of	_
the	_
person	_
before	_
killing	_
him	_
,	_
but	_
we	_
owe	_
God	_
,	_
this	_
will	_
only	_
be	_
a	_
delay	_
for	_
us	_
,	_
and	_
time	_
is	_
not	_
on	_
our	_
side	_
,	_
and	_
for	_
you	_
to	_
say	_
to	_
kill	_
him	_
outside	_
his	_
city	_
,	_
sometimes	_
it	_
take	_
months	_
before	_
the	_
person	_
leaves	_
his	_
city	_
,	_
like	_
if	_
it	_
's	_
in	_
Baghdad	_
for	_
example	_
,	_
that	_
's	_
difficult	_
,	_
and	_
time	_
is	_
not	_
on	_
our	_
side	_
,	_
we	_
waited	_
to	_
cut	_
the	_
heads	_
of	_
the	_
renegades	_
in	_
Hit	_
,	_
then	_
130	_
renegades	_
came	_
out	_
to	_
us	_
for	_
the	_
reason	_
that	_
we	_
did	_
n't	_
destroy	_
the	_
Islamic	_
Party	_
there	_
.	_

But	_
we	_
're	_
working	_
on	_
it	_
,	_
for	_
example	_
we	_
did	_
n't	_
kill	_
Nasr	_
al-Fahdawi	_
at	_
his	_
home	_
in	_
al-Sajriyah	_
,	_
but	_
the	_
guys	_
waited	_
for	_
him	_
until	_
he	_
got	_
out	_
of	_
the	_
Ramadi	_
province	_

Thanks	_
you	_
so	_
much	_
for	_
working	_
on	_
these	_
as	_
fast	_
as	_
you	_
have	_
-	_
there	_
was	_
a	_
priority	_
in	_

However	_

you	_

,	_
the	_
less	_
cash	_
outlay	_
that	_
we	_
have	_
right	_
now	_
the	_
better	_

Lets	_
wait	_

offset	_
the	_
amount	_
we	_
owe	_
them	_
with	_
what	_

-	_
so	_
I	_
say	_
wait	_
until	_
you	_
get	_
July	_

done	_

What	_
do	_
you	_
think	_

And	_
when	_

and	_
-	_
and	_
-	_
and	_
-	_
and	_
the	_
way	_
the	_
law	TARGET
reads	_
,	_
uh	_
,	_
if	_
they	_
sentence	TARGET
you	_
to	_
-	_

You	_
know	TARGET
it	_
's	_
crazy	TARGET
.	_

-	_
life	_
in	TARGET
prison	TARGET
then	_
he	_
's	_
available	_
for	_
parole	_
.	_

If	_
it	_
's	_
if	_
it	_
's	_
life	_
and	_
a	_
day	TARGET
then	_
he	_
's	_
not	_
eligible	_
for	_
parole	_
.	_

So	_
what	_
,	_
you	_
know	TARGET
,	_
let	_
's	_
quit	TARGET
BSing	_
with	_
the	_
system	TARGET
.	_

Yeah	_
.	_

Well	_
,	_
even	_
if	_
it	_
's	_
life	_
like	_
you	_
say	TARGET
,	_
we	_
end	TARGET
up	_
spending	_
sixty	TARGET
thousand	TARGET
dollars	_
a	_
year	TARGET
to	_
keep	TARGET
some	_
,	_
you	_
know	TARGET
,	_
joker	_
in	TARGET
there	_
for	_
life	_
.	_

We	_
could	TARGET
spend	_
that	_
money	TARGET
,	_
you	_
know	TARGET
,	_
for	_
starving	_
children	TARGET
that	_
are	_
starving	TARGET
or	_
twelve	_
million	TARGET
other	TARGET
things	_
would	_
be	_
more	TARGET
useful	TARGET
than	_
that	_
.	_

Exactly	_
.	_

So	_
to	_
me	_
if	_
somebody	_
has	TARGET
life	_
,	_
you	_
know	TARGET
,	_
beyond	TARGET
a	_
reasonable	TARGET
doubt	TARGET
,	_
they	_
should	TARGET
-	_
that	_
should	TARGET
be	_
it	_
-	_
you	_
know	TARGET
,	_
particularly	_
for	_
some	TARGET
of	_
these	_
really	_
.	_

A	_
life	_
for	_
a	_
life	_
.	_

I	_
mean	_
there	_
are	TARGET
so	_
many	TARGET
just	_
major	TARGET
major	TARGET
serial	_
murders	TARGET
and	_
it	_
's	_
not	_
just	_
like	_
one	TARGET
instance	TARGET
or	_
something	_
it	_
's	_
just	_
,	_
uh	_
,	_
horrifying	_
some	TARGET
of	_
the	_
murders	TARGET
that	_
go	TARGET
on	_
.	_

The	_
old	TARGET
Charles	_
Manson	_
case	TARGET
,	_
i	_
mean	_
,	_
the	_
guy	TARGET
is	_
really	_
-	_

Yeah	_
and	_
the	_
-	_
yeah	_
-	_
there	_
's	TARGET
just	_
everyday	_
you	_
hear	TARGET
on	_
the	_
news	_
of	_
another	TARGET
one	_
like	TARGET
that	_
um	_
.	_

Just	_
should	_
n't	_
be	_
allowed	TARGET
to	_
to	_
even	_
even	_
live	_
uh	_
about	_
the	_
issue	TARGET
about	_
sentencing	TARGET
by	_
the	_
judge	_
.	_

Yeah	_
.	_

Um	_
-hum	_
.	_

The	_
-	_
the	_
-	_
judge	TARGET
presently	_
has	TARGET
an	_
opportunity	_
to	_
intervene	_
.	_

Uh	_
,	_
when	_
there	_
's	_
-	_
uh	_
my	_
understanding	TARGET
-	_
when	_
there	_
's	TARGET
,	_
uh	_
,	_
a	_
verdict	TARGET
and	_
it	_
,	_
for	_
example	TARGET
,	_
there	_
's	TARGET
a	_
hung	_
jury	_
here	_
in	TARGET
Fort	_
Worth	_
two	TARGET
day	TARGET
in	_
eight	_
to	_
four	TARGET
and	_
bam	_
bam	_
the	_
guy	TARGET
got	_
off	_
.	_

Uh	_
,	_
he	_
was	_
,	_
uh	_
,	_
he	_
-	_
he	_
-	_
was	_
a	_
veterinarian	_
and	_
killed	TARGET
two	TARGET
-	_
a	_
father	TARGET
and	_
a	_
son	TARGET
-	_
okay	_
.	_

Right	_
,	_
yeah	_
,	_
I	_
heard	TARGET
about	TARGET
that	_
on	_
the	_
news	_
,	_
yeah	_
.	_

Um	_
,	_
kind	_
of	_
gets	_
back	_
to	_
the	_
second	_
request	_
we	_
've	_
been	_
asked	_
to	_
look	_
at	_
is	_
most	_
criminal	_
cases	_
requiring	_
an	_
ananimous	_
verdict	_
the	_
-	_
a	_
-	_
situation	_
like	_
that	_
,	_
i	_
'd	_
say	_
no.	_
Let	_
's	_
just	_
go	_
like	_
a	_
regular	_
vote	_
,	_
eight	_
to	_
four	_
,	_
tells	_
me	_
that	_
there	_
were	_
eight	_
-	_
there	_
's	_
a	_
percentage	_
certain	_
percentage	_
of	_
the	_
people	_
-	_
there	_
with	_
sixty	_
percent	_
of	_
the	_
people	_
,	_
uh	_
,	_
seventy	_
percent	_
of	_
the	_
people	_
said	_
hey	_
.	_

Right	_
rather	_
than	_
have	TARGET
to	_
retrial	_
the	_
whole	TARGET
whole	TARGET
thing	_
and	_
spend	_
all	TARGET
the	_
money	TARGET
for	_
people	TARGET
to	_
,	_
you	_
know	TARGET
,	_
go	_
back	_
to	_
court	TARGET
and	_
all	TARGET
the	_
lawyers	TARGET
and	_
i	_
mean	_
it	_
just	_
winds	_
up	_
costing	TARGET
the	_
taxpayers	_
a	_
fortune	_
-	_
you	_
know	TARGET
,	_
a	_
fortune	_
-	_
to	_
keep	TARGET
doing	TARGET
that	_
.	_

The	_
guy	TARGET
's	_
guilty	TARGET
.	_

Exactly	_
.	_

And	_
the	_
victims	TARGET
you	_
know	TARGET
the	_
family	TARGET
of	_
these	_
people	TARGET
that	_
have	_
been	_
murdered	TARGET
they	_
just	_
have	TARGET
to	_
have	_
it	_
dragged	TARGET
on	_
for	_
years	TARGET
and	_
years	TARGET
before	TARGET
they	_
ever	_
get	_
any	_
resolution	_
.	_

Exactly	_
because	TARGET
it	_
's	_
not	_
next	TARGET
day	TARGET
they	_
have	_
the	_
start	TARGET
the	_
trial	TARGET
which	_
is	_
X	_
number	TARGET
of	_
months	TARGET
and	_
just	_
prolongs	TARGET
the	_
situation	_
that	_
much	_
more	TARGET
.	_

Right	_
.	_

Yeah	_
yeah	_
.	_

I	_
think	TARGET
that	_
that	_
if	_
it	_
's	_
-	_
if	_
it	_
's	_
-	_
not	_
a	_
split	_
decision	TARGET
,	_
uh	_
,	_
go	_
with	_
the	_
highest	TARGET
number	TARGET
and	_
let	_
's	_
just	_
get	_
on	_
with	_
the	_
program	TARGET
.	_

Yeah	_
.	_

Yeah	_
.	_

Uh	_
but	_
as	_
far	_
as	_
the	_
sentencing	_
by	_
the	_
judge	_
,	_
i	_
would	_
have	_
to	_
vote	_
against	_
that	_
since	_
there	_
's	_
a	_
jury	_
because	_
that	_
's	_
what	_
the	_
juries	_
are	_
for	_
is	_
to	_
make	_
the	_
decision	_
.	_
Um	_
,	_
what	_
are	_
your	_
feelings	_
?	_

Yeah	_
.	_

Yeah	_
.	_

Well	_
if	_
I	_
-	_
I	_
saw	TARGET
on	_
one	TARGET
of	TARGET
the	_
talk	_
shows	_
this	_
woman	TARGET
judge	_
i	_
believe	TARGET
from	TARGET
Florida	_
and	_
she	_
just	_
has	TARGET
just	_
really	_
stiff	_
penalties	TARGET
and	_
i	_
saw	TARGET
that	_
in	_
in	_
the	_
hands	TARGET
of	_
a	_
judge	_
that	_
really	_
was	_
conscientious	_
and	_
really	_
,	_
you	_
know	TARGET
,	_
took	_
the	_
pains	TARGET
to	_
give	TARGET
a	_
sentence	TARGET
for	_
what	_
was	_
deserved	TARGET
,	_
it	_
could	TARGET
-	_
you	_
could	TARGET
have	TARGET
a	_
-	_
a	_
judge	_
that	_
would	_
really	_
make	_
a	_
good	TARGET
impact	TARGET
,	_
but	_
likewise	_
you	_
could	TARGET
have	TARGET
the	_
flip	_
side	TARGET
and	_
have	TARGET
some	_
judge	_
that	_
was	_
paid	_
off	_
or	_
you	_
know	TARGET
had	TARGET
good	TARGET
-	_
a	_
good	TARGET
old	TARGET
boy	_
network	TARGET
,	_
or	_
,	_
for	_
whatever	_
reasons	_
,	_
you	_
know	TARGET
,	_
politics	_
,	_
just	_
let	_
all	TARGET
kinds	TARGET
of	TARGET
people	TARGET
through	_
so	_
he	_
-	_
he	_
would	_
have	TARGET
a	_
heck	_
-	_
or	_
-	_
she	_
would	_
have	TARGET
a	_
heck	_
of	_
a	_
lot	TARGET
of	_
power	TARGET
,	_
you	_
know	TARGET
,	_
if	_
used	TARGET
wrongly	_
.	_

So	_
,	_
at	_
least	_
the	_
jury	_
system	TARGET
does	TARGET
something	_
to	_
prevent	TARGET
that	_
,	_
you	_
know	TARGET
,	_
or	_
help	TARGET
it	_
-	_
with	_
it	_
-	_
anyway	_
.	_

I	_
do	_
n't	_
know	TARGET
if	_
it	_
prevents	TARGET
it	_
but	_
seems	TARGET
like	_
the	_
jury	_
system	TARGET
does	_
have	TARGET
it	_
's	_
advantages	_
,	_
but	_
i	_
also	_
-	_
i	_
've	_
also	_
heard	TARGET
on	_
trials	TARGET
that	_
sometimes	TARGET
they	_
go	_
through	_
,	_
like	_
,	_
three	TARGET
hundred	TARGET
jurors	_
before	_
they	_
hand	_
pick	TARGET
these	_
jurors	_
that	_
they	_
think	TARGET
are	_
going	_
to	_
be	_
the	_
ones	_
that	_
are	_
going	_
to	_
be	_
the	_
most	_
lenient	TARGET
you	_
know	TARGET
.	_

And	_
i	_
do	_
n't	_
know	TARGET
how	_
much	_
they	_
're	_
getting	TARGET
just	_
a	_
jury	_
of	_
their	_
peers	_
at	_
that	_
point	_
.	_

They	_
're	_
really	_
getting	TARGET
a	_
select	_
group	TARGET
.	_

It	_
's	_
not	_
just	_
random	_
people	TARGET
.	_

Hm	_
.	_

It	_
almost	_
should	TARGET
be	_
the	_
first	TARGET
twelve	_
people	TARGET
that	_
they	_
-	_
you	_
know	TARGET
-	_
that	_
have	TARGET
on	_
a	_
list	TARGET
are	_
the	_
ones	_
that	_
are	_
on	_
the	_
jury	_
and	_
that	_
's	_
it	_
.	_

Yeah	_
,	_
yeah	_
,	_
I	_
get	_
back	_
to	_
Price	_
's	_
comment	TARGET
when	_
he	_
,	_
uh	_
,	_
was	_
found	TARGET
guilty	TARGET
he	_
said	TARGET
,	_
well	_
,	_
he	_
did	_
n't	_
have	TARGET
any	_
blacks	_
,	_
uh	_
,	_
you	_
know	TARGET
from	_
his	_
neck	_
of	_
the	_
woods	TARGET
.	_

Well	_
,	_
give	TARGET
me	_
a	_
break	_
you	_
know	TARGET

You	_
know	TARGET

He	_
'd	_

to	_
have	TARGET
his	_
whole	_

up	_
there	_
for	_
him	_
to	_
feel	_
like	_
he	_
's	TARGET
got	_
his	_

or	_
something	_
,	_
yeah	_

Exactly	_

,	_
uh	_
,	_
like	_
in	_
a	_
murder	TARGET
situations	_
,	_
they	_
look	TARGET
for	_
juries	_
who	_
do	_
n't	_
know	TARGET
anything	_
about	_
the	_
system	TARGET
well	_
or	_
know	TARGET
anything	_
about	_
the	_

the	_

You	_
'd	_

a	_
cave	TARGET
not	_
to	_
know	TARGET
what	_
's	_
going	TARGET
on	_

Or	_
moving	TARGET
it	_
to	TARGET
Lubbock	_
or	_
somewhere	_
possibly	TARGET
is	_
not	_
the	_
answer	TARGET
.	_

Yeah	_
.	_

Oh	_
,	_
they	_
'd	_
have	TARGET
to	_
move	TARGET
it	_
to	TARGET
Taiwan	_
for	_
people	TARGET
not	_
to	_
know	TARGET
about	_
it	_
practically	_
.	_

This	_
is	_
true	_
-	_
so	_
true	_
.	_

Well	_
,	_
this	_
has	_
been	_
an	_
interesting	TARGET
conversation	TARGET

Yeah	_
Yeah	_
.	_

Well	_

is	_

One	_
of	_
Sherlock	_
Holmes	_
's	_
defects	_
--	_
if	_
,	_
indeed	_
,	_
one	_
may	_
call	_
it	_
a	_
defect	_
--	_
was	_
that	_
he	_
was	_
exceedingly	_
loath	_
to	_
communicate	_
his	_
full	_
plans	_
to	_
any	_
other	_
person	_
until	_
the	_
instant	_
of	_
their	_
fulfilment	_
.	_

Partly	_
it	_
came	_
no	_
doubt	_
from	_
his	_
own	_
masterful	_
nature	_
,	_
which	_
loved	_
to	_
dominate	_
and	_
surprise	_
those	_
who	_
were	_
around	_
him	_
.	_

Partly	_
also	_
from	_
his	_
professional	_
caution	_
,	_
which	_
urged	_
him	_
never	_
to	_
take	_
any	_
chances	_
.	_

The	_
result	_
,	_
however	_
,	_
was	_
very	_
trying	_
for	_
those	_
who	_
were	_
acting	_
as	_
his	_
agents	_
and	_
assistants	_
.	_

I	_
had	_
often	_
suffered	_
under	_
it	_
,	_
but	_
never	_
more	_
so	_
than	_
during	_
that	_
long	_
drive	_
in	_
the	_
darkness	_
.	_

The	_
great	_
ordeal	_
was	_
in	_
front	_
of	_
us	_
;	_
at	_
last	_
we	_
were	_
about	_
to	_
make	_
our	_
final	_
effort	_
,	_
and	_
yet	_
Holmes	_
had	_
said	_
nothing	_
,	_
and	_
I	_
could	_
only	_
surmise	_
what	_
his	_
course	_
of	_
action	_
would	_
be	_
.	_

My	_
nerves	_
thrilled	_
with	_
anticipation	_
when	_
at	_
last	_
the	_
cold	_
wind	_
upon	_
our	_
faces	_
and	_
the	_
dark	_
,	_
void	_
spaces	_
on	_
either	_
side	_
of	_
the	_
narrow	_
road	_
told	_
me	_
that	_
we	_
were	_
back	_
upon	_
the	_
moor	_
once	_
again	_
.	_

Every	_
stride	_
of	_
the	_
horses	_
and	_
every	_
turn	_
of	_
the	_
wheels	_
was	_
taking	_
us	_
nearer	_
to	_
our	_
supreme	_
adventure	_
.	_

Our	_
conversation	_
was	_
hampered	_
by	_
the	_
presence	_
of	_
the	_
driver	_
of	_
the	_
hired	_
wagonette	_
,	_
so	_
that	_
we	_
were	_
forced	_
to	_
talk	_
of	_
trivial	_
matters	_
when	_
our	_
nerves	_
were	_
tense	_
with	_
emotion	_
and	_
anticipation	_
.	_

It	_
was	_
a	_
relief	_
to	_
me	_
,	_
after	_
that	_
unnatural	_
restraint	_
,	_
when	_
we	_
at	_
last	_
passed	_
Frankland	_
's	_
house	_
and	_
knew	_
that	_
we	_
were	_
drawing	_
near	_
to	_
the	_
Hall	_
and	_
to	_
the	_
scene	_
of	_
action	_
.	_

We	_
did	_
not	_
drive	_
up	_
to	_
the	_
door	_
but	_
got	_
down	_
near	_
the	_
gate	_
of	_
the	_
avenue	_
.	_

The	_
wagonette	_
was	_
paid	_
off	_
and	_
ordered	_
to	_
return	_
to	_
Coombe	_
Tracey	_
forthwith	_
,	_
while	_
we	_
started	_
to	_
walk	_
to	_
Merripit	_
House	_
.	_

``	_
Are	_
you	_
armed	_
,	_
Lestrade	_
?	_
''	_

The	_
little	_
detective	_
smiled	_
.	_

``	_
As	_
long	_
as	_
I	_
have	_
my	_
trousers	_

it	_

``	_
Good	_

My	_
friend	_
and	_
I	_
are	_
also	_
ready	_
for	_

``	_
A	_
waiting	_
game	_

``	_
My	_
word	_
,	_
it	_
does	_
not	_
seem	_
a	_
very	_
cheerful	_
place	_

''	_
said	_
the	_
detective	_
with	_
a	_
shiver	_
,	_
glancing	_
round	_
him	_
at	_
the	_
gloomy	_
slopes	_
of	_
the	_
hill	_
and	_
at	_
the	_
huge	_
lake	_
of	_
fog	_
which	_
lay	_
over	_
the	_
Grimpen	_
Mire	_
.	_

``	_
I	_
see	_
the	_
lights	_
of	_
a	_
house	_
ahead	_
of	_
us	_

''	_

``	_
That	_
is	_
Merripit	_

the	_
end	_

journey	_

I	_
must	_
request	_
you	_
to	_
walk	_
on	_
tiptoe	_
and	_
not	_
to	_
talk	_
above	_
a	_
whisper	_

''	_

We	_
moved	_
cautiously	_
along	_
the	_
track	_
as	_
if	_
we	_
were	_
bound	_
for	_
the	_
house	_
,	_
but	_
Holmes	_
halted	_
us	_
when	_
we	_
were	_
about	_
two	_
hundred	_
yards	_
from	_
it	_
.	_

``	_
This	_
will	_
do	_

''	_
said	_
he	_

``	_
These	_

``	_

``	_
I	_

``	_

``	_

''	_

I	_
tiptoed	_
down	_
the	_
path	_
and	_
stooped	_
behind	_
the	_
low	_
wall	_
which	_
surrounded	_
the	_
stunted	_
orchard	_
.	_

Creeping	_
in	_
its	_
shadow	_
I	_
reached	_
a	_
point	_
whence	_
I	_
could	_
look	_
straight	_
through	_
the	_
uncurtained	_
window	_
.	_

There	_
were	TARGET
only	TARGET
two	TARGET
men	TARGET
in	TARGET
the	_
room	TARGET
,	_
Sir	_
Henry	_
and	_
Stapleton	_
.	_

They	_
sat	TARGET
with	_
their	_
profiles	_
towards	_
me	_
on	TARGET
either	_
side	TARGET
of	_
the	_
round	_
table	_
.	_

Both	_
of	_
them	_
were	_
smoking	TARGET
cigars	_
,	_
and	_
coffee	TARGET
and	_
wine	_
were	_
in	_
front	_
of	_
them	_
.	_

Stapleton	_
was	_
talking	TARGET
with	_
animation	_
,	_
but	_
the	_
baronet	_
looked	TARGET
pale	_
and	_
distrait	_
.	_

Perhaps	_
the	_
thought	TARGET
of	_
that	_
lonely	_
walk	TARGET
across	_
the	_
ill	_
-	_
omened	_
moor	TARGET
was	_
weighing	_
heavily	_
upon	_
his	_
mind	_
.	_

As	_
I	_
watched	TARGET
them	_
Stapleton	_
rose	TARGET
and	_
left	TARGET
the	_
room	TARGET
,	_
while	TARGET
Sir	_
Henry	_
filled	TARGET
his	_
glass	TARGET
again	_
and	_
leaned	TARGET
back	_
in	TARGET
his	_
chair	_
,	_
puffing	TARGET
at	_
his	_
cigar	_
.	_

I	_
heard	TARGET
the	_
creak	TARGET
of	_
a	_
door	TARGET
and	_
the	_
crisp	_
sound	TARGET
of	_
boots	TARGET
upon	TARGET
gravel	_
.	_

The	_
steps	TARGET
passed	TARGET
along	TARGET
the	_
path	TARGET
on	TARGET
the	_
other	TARGET
side	TARGET
of	_
the	_
wall	TARGET
under	TARGET
which	_
I	_
crouched	TARGET
.	_

Looking	TARGET
over	_
,	_
I	_
saw	TARGET
the	_
naturalist	_
pause	_
at	_
the	_
door	TARGET
of	_
an	_
outhouse	TARGET
in	_
the	_
corner	_
of	_
the	_
orchard	_
.	_

A	_
key	TARGET
turned	TARGET
in	_
a	_
lock	_
,	_
and	_
as	_
he	_
passed	TARGET
in	_
there	_
was	TARGET
a	_
curious	_
scuffling	_
noise	TARGET
from	_
within	_
.	_

He	_
was	_
only	_
a	_
minute	TARGET
or	_
so	_
inside	TARGET
,	_
and	_
then	_
I	_
heard	TARGET
the	_
key	_
turn	TARGET
once	_
more	_
and	_
he	_
passed	TARGET
me	_
and	_
re	_
-	_
entered	_
the	_
house	_
.	_

I	_
saw	_
him	_
rejoin	_
his	_
guest	_
,	_
and	_
I	_
crept	_
quietly	_
back	_
to	_
where	_
my	_
companions	_
were	_
waiting	_
to	_
tell	_
them	_
what	_
I	_
had	_
seen	_
.	_

``	_
You	_
say	_
,	_
Watson	_
,	_
that	_
the	_
lady	_
is	_
not	_
there	_
?	_
''	_
Holmes	_
asked	_
,	_
when	_
I	_
had	_
finished	_
my	_
report	_
.	_

``	_
No	_
.	_
''	_

``	_
Where	_
can	_
she	_
be	_
,	_
then	_
,	_
since	_
there	_
is	_
no	_
light	_

any	_

room	_

the	_
kitchen	_
?	_
''	_

``	_
I	_
can	_
not	_
think	_
where	_
she	_
is	_
.	_
''	_

I	_
have	_
said	_
that	_
over	_
the	_
great	_
Grimpen	_
Mire	_
there	_
hung	_
a	_
dense	_
,	_
white	_
fog	_
.	_

It	_
was	_
drifting	_
slowly	_
in	_
our	_
direction	_
,	_
and	_
banked	_
itself	_
up	_
like	_
a	_
wall	_
on	_
that	_
side	_
of	_
us	_
,	_
low	_
,	_
but	_
thick	_
and	_
well	_
defined	_
.	_

The	_
moon	_
shone	_
on	_
it	_
,	_
and	_
it	_
looked	_
like	_
a	_
great	_
shimmering	_
ice	_
-	_
field	_
,	_
with	_
the	_
heads	_
of	_
the	_
distant	_
tors	_
as	_
rocks	_
borne	_
upon	_
its	_
surface	_
.	_

Holmes	_
's	_
face	_
was	_
turned	_
towards	_
it	_
,	_
and	_
he	_
muttered	_
impatiently	_
as	_
he	_
watched	_
its	_
sluggish	_
drift	_
.	_

``	_
It	_
's	_
moving	_
towards	_
us	_
,	_
Watson	_
.	_
''	_

``	_
Is	_
that	_
serious	_
?	_
''	_

``	_
Very	_
serious	_
,	_
indeed	_
--	_
the	_
one	_
thing	_
upon	_
earth	_
which	_
could	_

disarranged	_
my	_
plans	_

He	_
ca	_

be	_
very	_
long	_
,	_
now	_

It	_
is	_
already	_
ten	_
o'clock	_
.	_

Our	_
success	_
and	_
even	_
his	_
life	_
may	_
depend	_
upon	_
his	_
coming	_
out	_
before	_
the	_
fog	_
is	_
over	_
the	_
path	_
.	_
''	_

The	_
night	_
was	_
clear	_
and	_
fine	_
above	_
us	_
.	_

The	_
stars	_
shone	_
cold	_
and	_
bright	_
,	_
while	_
a	_
half	_
-	_
moon	_
bathed	_
the	_
whole	_
scene	_
in	_
a	_
soft	_
,	_
uncertain	_
light	_
.	_

Before	_
us	_
lay	_
the	_
dark	_
bulk	_
of	_
the	_
house	_
,	_
its	_
serrated	_
roof	_
and	_
bristling	_
chimneys	_
hard	_
outlined	_
against	_
the	_
silver	_
-	_
spangled	_
sky	_
.	_

Broad	_
bars	_
of	_
golden	_
light	_
from	_
the	_
lower	_
windows	_
stretched	_
across	_
the	_
orchard	_
and	_
the	_
moor	_
.	_

One	_
of	_
them	_
was	_
suddenly	_
shut	_
off	_
.	_

The	_
servants	_
had	_
left	_
the	_
kitchen	_
.	_

There	_
only	_
remained	_
the	_
lamp	_
in	_
the	_
dining	_
room	_
where	_
the	_
two	_
men	_
,	_
the	_
murderous	_
host	_
and	_
the	_
unconscious	_
guest	_
,	_
still	_
chatted	_
over	_
their	_
cigars	_
.	_

Every	_
minute	_
that	_
white	_
woolly	_
plain	_
which	_
covered	_
one	_
half	_
of	_
the	_
moor	_
was	_
drifting	_
closer	_
and	_
closer	_
to	_
the	_
house	_
.	_

Already	_
the	_
first	_
thin	_
wisps	_
of	_
it	_
were	_
curling	_
across	_
the	_
golden	_
square	_
of	_
the	_
lighted	_
window	_
.	_

The	_
farther	_
wall	_
of	_
the	_
orchard	_
was	_
already	_
invisible	_
,	_
and	_
the	_
trees	_
were	_
standing	_
out	_
of	_
a	_
swirl	_
of	_
white	_
vapour	_
.	_

As	_
we	_
watched	_
it	_
the	_
fog	_
-	_
wreaths	_
came	_
crawling	_
round	_
both	_
corners	_
of	_
the	_
house	_
and	_
rolled	_
slowly	_
into	_
one	_
dense	_
bank	_
,	_
on	_
which	_
the	_
upper	_
floor	_
and	_
the	_
roof	_
floated	_
like	_
a	_
strange	_
ship	_
upon	_
a	_
shadowy	_
sea	_
.	_

Holmes	_
struck	_
his	_
hand	_
passionately	_
upon	_
the	_
rock	_
in	_
front	_
of	_
us	_
and	_
stamped	_
his	_
feet	_
in	_
his	_
impatience	_
.	_

``	_
If	_
he	_
is	_
n't	_
out	_
in	_
a	_
quarter	_
of	_
an	_
hour	_
the	_
path	_
will	_
be	_
covered	_
.	_

In	_
half	_
an	_
hour	_
we	_
wo	_
n't	_
be	_
able	_
to	_
see	_
our	_
hands	_
in	_
front	_
of	_
us	_
.	_
''	_

``	_
Shall	_
we	_
move	_
farther	_
back	_
upon	_
higher	_
ground	_
?	_
''	_

``	_
Yes	_
,	_
I	_
think	_
it	_
would	_
be	_
as	_
well	_
.	_
''	_

So	_
as	_
the	_
fog	_
-	_
bank	_
flowed	_
onward	_
we	_
fell	_
back	_
before	_
it	_
until	_
we	_
were	_
half	_
a	_
mile	_
from	_
the	_
house	_
,	_
and	_
still	_
that	_
dense	_
white	_
sea	_
,	_
with	_
the	_
moon	_
silvering	_
its	_
upper	_
edge	_
,	_
swept	_
slowly	_
and	_
inexorably	_
on	_
.	_

``	_
We	_
are	_
going	_
too	_
far	_
,	_
''	_
said	_
Holmes	_
.	_

``	_
We	_
dare	_
not	_
take	_
the	_
chance	_
of	_
his	_
being	_
overtaken	_
before	_
he	_
can	_
reach	_
us	_
.	_

At	_
all	_
costs	_
we	_
must	_
hold	_
our	_
ground	_
where	_
we	_
are	_
.	_
''	_

He	_
dropped	_
on	_
his	_
knees	_
and	_
clapped	_
his	_
ear	_
to	_
the	_
ground	_
.	_

``	_
Thank	_
God	_
,	_
I	_
think	_
that	_
I	_
hear	_
him	_
coming	_
.	_
''	_

A	_
sound	_
of	_
quick	_
steps	_
broke	_
the	_
silence	_
of	_
the	_
moor	_
.	_

Crouching	_
among	_
the	_
stones	_
we	_
stared	_
intently	_
at	_
the	_
silver-tipped	_
bank	_
in	_
front	_
of	_
us	_
.	_

The	_
steps	_
grew	_
louder	_
,	_
and	_
through	_
the	_
fog	_
,	_
as	_
through	_
a	_
curtain	_
,	_
there	_
stepped	_
the	_
man	_
whom	_
we	_
were	_
awaiting	_
.	_

He	_
looked	_
round	_
him	_
in	_
surprise	_
as	_
he	_
emerged	_
into	_
the	_
clear	_
,	_
starlit	_
night	_
.	_

Then	_
he	_
came	_
swiftly	_
along	_
the	_
path	_
,	_
passed	_
close	_
to	_
where	_
we	_
lay	_
,	_
and	_
went	_
on	_
up	_
the	_
long	_
slope	_
behind	_
us	_
.	_

As	_
he	_
walked	_
he	_
glanced	_
continually	_
over	_
either	_
shoulder	_
,	_
like	_
a	_
man	_
who	_
is	_
ill	_
at	_
ease	_
.	_

``	_
Hist	_
!	_
''	_
cried	_
Holmes	_
,	_
and	_
I	_
heard	_
the	_
sharp	_
click	_
of	_
a	_
cocking	_
pistol	_
.	_

``	_
Look	_
out	_
!	_

It	_
's	_
coming	_
!	_
''	_

There	_
was	_
a	_
thin	_
,	_
crisp	_
,	_
continuous	_
patter	_
from	_
somewhere	_
in	_
the	_
heart	_
of	_
that	_
crawling	_
bank	_
.	_

The	_
cloud	_
was	_
within	_
fifty	_
yards	_
of	_
where	_
we	_
lay	_
,	_
and	_
we	_
glared	_
at	_
it	_
,	_
all	_
three	_
,	_
uncertain	_
what	_
horror	_
was	_
about	_
to	_
break	_
from	_
the	_
heart	_
of	_
it	_
.	_

I	_
was	_
at	_
Holmes	_
's	_
elbow	_
,	_
and	_
I	_
glanced	_
for	_
an	_
instant	_
at	_
his	_
face	_
.	_

It	_
was	_
pale	_
and	_
exultant	_
,	_
his	_
eyes	_
shining	_
brightly	_
in	_
the	_
moonlight	_
.	_

But	_
suddenly	_
they	_
started	_
forward	_
in	_
a	_
rigid	_
,	_
fixed	_
stare	_
,	_
and	_
his	_
lips	_
parted	_
in	_
amazement	_
.	_

At	_
the	_
same	_
instant	_
Lestrade	_
gave	_
a	_
yell	_
of	_
terror	_
and	_
threw	_
himself	_
face	_
downward	_
upon	_
the	_
ground	_
.	_

I	_
sprang	_
to	_
my	_
feet	_
,	_
my	_
inert	_
hand	_
grasping	_
my	_
pistol	_
,	_
my	_
mind	_
paralyzed	_
by	_
the	_
dreadful	_
shape	_
which	_
had	_
sprung	_
out	_
upon	_
us	_
from	_
the	_
shadows	_
of	_
the	_
fog	_
.	_

A	_
hound	_
it	_
was	_
,	_
an	_
enormous	_
coal	_
-	_
black	_
hound	_
,	_
but	_
not	_
such	_
a	_
hound	_
as	_
mortal	_
eyes	_
have	_
ever	_
seen	_
.	_

Fire	_
burst	_
from	_
its	_
open	_
mouth	_
,	_
its	_
eyes	_
glowed	_
with	_
a	_
smouldering	_
glare	_
,	_
its	_
muzzle	_
and	_
hackles	_
and	_
dewlap	_
were	_
outlined	_
in	_
flickering	_
flame	_
.	_

Never	_
in	_
the	_
delirious	_
dream	_
of	_
a	_
disordered	_
brain	_
could	_
anything	_
more	_
savage	_
,	_
more	_
appalling	_
,	_
more	_
hellish	_
be	_
conceived	_
than	_
that	_
dark	_
form	_
and	_
savage	_
face	_
which	_
broke	_
upon	_
us	_
out	_
of	_
the	_
wall	_
of	_
fog	_
.	_

With	_
long	_
bounds	_
the	_
huge	_
black	_
creature	_
was	_
leaping	_
down	_
the	_
track	_
,	_
following	_
hard	_
upon	_
the	_
footsteps	_
of	_
our	_
friend	_
.	_

So	_
paralyzed	_
were	_
we	_
by	_
the	_
apparition	_
that	_
we	_
allowed	_
him	_
to	_
pass	_
before	_
we	_
had	_
recovered	_
our	_
nerve	_
.	_

Then	_
Holmes	_
and	_
I	_
both	_
fired	_
together	_
,	_
and	_
the	_
creature	_
gave	_
a	_
hideous	_
howl	_
,	_
which	_
showed	_
that	_
one	_
at	_
least	_
had	_
hit	_
him	_
.	_

He	_
did	_
not	_
pause	_
,	_
however	_
,	_
but	_
bounded	_
onward	_
.	_

Far	_
away	_
on	_
the	_
path	_
we	_
saw	_
Sir	_
Henry	_
looking	_
back	_
,	_
his	_
face	_
white	_
in	_
the	_
moonlight	_
,	_
his	_
hands	_
raised	_
in	_
horror	_
,	_
glaring	_
helplessly	_
at	_
the	_
frightful	_
thing	_
which	_
was	_
hunting	_
him	_
down	_
.	_

But	_
that	_
cry	_
of	_
pain	_
from	_
the	_
hound	_
had	_
blown	_
all	_
our	_
fears	_
to	_
the	_
winds	_
.	_

If	_
he	_
was	_
vulnerable	_
he	_
was	_
mortal	_
,	_
and	_
if	_
we	_
could	_
wound	_
him	_
we	_
could	_
kill	_
him	_
.	_

Never	_
have	_
I	_
seen	_
a	_
man	_
run	_
as	_
Holmes	_
ran	_
that	_
night	_
.	_

I	_
am	_
reckoned	_
fleet	_
of	_
foot	_
,	_
but	_
he	_
outpaced	_
me	_
as	_
much	_
as	_
I	_
outpaced	_
the	_
little	_
professional	_
.	_

In	_
front	_
of	_
us	_
as	_
we	_
flew	_
up	_
the	_
track	_
we	_
heard	_
scream	_
after	_
scream	_
from	_
Sir	_
Henry	_
and	_
the	_
deep	_
roar	_
of	_
the	_
hound	_
.	_

I	_
was	_
in	_
time	_
to	_
see	_
the	_
beast	_
spring	_
upon	_
its	_
victim	_
,	_
hurl	_
him	_
to	_
the	_
ground	_
,	_
and	_
worry	_
at	_
his	_
throat	_
.	_

But	_
the	_
next	_
instant	_
Holmes	_
had	_
emptied	_
five	_
barrels	_
of	_
his	_
revolver	_
into	_
the	_
creature	_
's	_
flank	_
.	_

With	_
a	_
last	_
howl	_
of	_
agony	_
and	_
a	_
vicious	_
snap	_
in	_
the	_
air	_
,	_
it	_
rolled	_
upon	_
its	_
back	_
,	_
four	_
feet	_
pawing	_
furiously	_
,	_
and	_
then	_
fell	_
limp	_
upon	_
its	_
side	_
.	_

I	_
stooped	_
,	_
panting	_
,	_
and	_
pressed	_
my	_
pistol	_
to	_
the	_
dreadful	_
,	_
shimmering	_
head	_
,	_
but	_
it	_
was	_
useless	_
to	_
press	_
the	_
trigger	_
.	_

The	_
giant	_
hound	_
was	_
dead	_
.	_

Sir	_
Henry	_
lay	_
insensible	_
where	_
he	_
had	_
fallen	_
.	_

We	_
tore	_
away	_
his	_
collar	_
,	_
and	_
Holmes	_
breathed	_
a	_
prayer	_
of	_
gratitude	_
when	_
we	_
saw	_
that	_
there	_
was	_
no	_
sign	_
of	_
a	_
wound	_
and	_
that	_
the	_
rescue	_
had	_
been	_
in	_
time	_
.	_

Already	_
our	_
friend	_
's	_
eyelids	_
shivered	_
and	_
he	_
made	_
a	_
feeble	_
effort	_
to	_
move	_
.	_

Lestrade	_
thrust	_
his	_
brandy	_
-	_
flask	_
between	_
the	_
baronet	_
's	_
teeth	_
,	_
and	_
two	_
frightened	_
eyes	_
were	_
looking	_
up	_
at	_
us	_
.	_

``	_
My	_
God	_
!	_
''	_
he	_
whispered	_
.	_

``	_
What	_
was	_
it	_
?	_

What	_
,	_
in	_
heaven	_
's	_
name	_
,	_
was	_
it	_
?	_
''	_

``	_
It	_
's	_
dead	_
,	_
whatever	_
it	_
is	_
,	_
''	_
said	_
Holmes	_
.	_

``	_
We	_
've	_
laid	_
the	_
family	_
ghost	_
once	_
and	_
forever	_
.	_
''	_

In	_
mere	_
size	_
and	_
strength	_
it	_
was	_
a	_
terrible	_
creature	_
which	_
was	_
lying	_
stretched	_
before	_
us	_
.	_

It	_
was	_
not	_
a	_
pure	_
bloodhound	_
and	_
it	_
was	_
not	_
a	_
pure	_
mastiff	_
;	_
but	_
it	_
appeared	_
to	_
be	_
a	_
combination	_
of	_
the	_
two	_
--	_
gaunt	_
,	_
savage	_
,	_
and	_
as	_
large	_
as	_
a	_
small	_
lioness	_
.	_

Even	_
now	_
,	_
in	_
the	_
stillness	_
of	_
death	_
,	_
the	_
huge	_
jaws	_
seemed	_
to	_
be	_
dripping	_
with	_
a	_
bluish	_
flame	_
and	_
the	_
small	_
,	_
deep	_
-	_
set	_
,	_
cruel	_
eyes	_
were	_
ringed	_
with	_
fire	_
.	_

I	_
placed	_
my	_
hand	_
upon	_
the	_
glowing	_
muzzle	_
,	_
and	_
as	_
I	_
held	_
them	_
up	_
my	_
own	_
fingers	_
smouldered	_
and	_
gleamed	_
in	_
the	_
darkness	_
.	_

``	_
Phosphorus	_
,	_
''	_
I	_
said	_
.	_

``	_
A	_
cunning	_
preparation	_
of	_
it	_
,	_
''	_
said	_
Holmes	_
,	_
sniffing	_
at	_
the	_
dead	_
animal	_
.	_

``	_
There	_
is	_
no	_
smell	_
which	_
might	_
have	_
interfered	_
with	_
his	_
power	_
of	_
scent	_
.	_

We	_
owe	_
you	_
a	_
deep	_
apology	_
,	_
Sir	_
Henry	_
,	_
for	_
having	_
exposed	_
you	_
to	_
this	_
fright	_
.	_

I	_
was	_
prepared	_
for	_
a	_
hound	_
,	_
but	_
not	_
for	_
such	_
a	_
creature	_
as	_
this	_
.	_

And	_
the	_
fog	_
gave	_
us	_
little	_
time	_
to	_
receive	_
him	_
.	_
''	_

``	_
You	_
have	_
saved	_
my	_
life	_
.	_
''	_

``	_
Having	_
first	_
endangered	_
it	_
.	_

Are	_
you	_
strong	_
enough	_
to	_
stand	_
?	_
''	_

``	_
Give	_
me	_
another	_
mouthful	_
of	_
that	_
brandy	_
and	_
I	_
shall	_
be	_
ready	_
for	_
anything	_
.	_

So	_
!	_

Now	_
,	_
if	_
you	_
will	_
help	_
me	_
up	_
.	_

What	_
do	_
you	_
propose	_
to	_
do	_
?	_
''	_

``	_
To	_
leave	_
you	_
here	_
.	_

You	_
are	_
not	_
fit	_
for	_
further	_
adventures	_
tonight	_
.	_

If	_
you	_
will	_
wait	_
,	_
one	_
or	_
other	_
of	_
us	_
will	_
go	_
back	_
with	_
you	_
to	_
the	_
Hall	_
.	_
''	_

He	_
tried	_
to	_
stagger	_
to	_
his	_
feet	_
;	_
but	_
he	_
was	_
still	_
ghastly	_
pale	_
and	_
trembling	_
in	_
every	_
limb	_
.	_

We	_
helped	_
him	_
to	_
a	_
rock	_
,	_
where	_
he	_
sat	_
shivering	_
with	_
his	_
face	_
buried	_
in	_
his	_
hands	_
.	_

``	_
We	_
must	_
leave	_
you	_
now	_
,	_
''	_
said	_
Holmes	_
.	_

``	_
The	_
rest	_
of	_
our	_
work	_
must	_
be	_
done	_
,	_
and	_
every	_
moment	_
is	_
of	_
importance	_
.	_

We	_
have	_
our	_
case	_
,	_
and	_
now	_
we	_
only	_
want	_
our	_
man	_
.	_

``	_
It	_
's	_
a	_
thousand	_
to	_
one	_
against	_
our	_
finding	_
him	_
at	_
the	_
house	_
,	_
''	_
he	_
continued	_
as	_
we	_
retraced	_
our	_
steps	_
swiftly	_
down	_
the	_
path	_
.	_

``	_
Those	_
shots	_
must	_
have	_
told	_
him	_
that	_
the	_
game	_
was	_
up	_
.	_
''	_

``	_
We	_
were	_
some	_
distance	_
off	_
,	_
and	_
this	_
fog	_
may	_
have	_
deadened	_
them	_
.	_
''	_

``	_
He	_
followed	_
the	_
hound	_
to	_
call	_
him	_
off	_
--	_
of	_
that	_
you	_
may	_
be	_
certain	_
.	_

No	_
,	_
no	_
,	_
he	_
's	_
gone	_
by	_
this	_
time	_
!	_

But	_
we	_
'll	_
search	_
the	_
house	_
and	_
make	_
sure	_
.	_
''	_

The	_
front	_
door	_
was	_
open	_
,	_
so	_
we	_
rushed	_
in	_
and	_
hurried	_
from	_
room	_
to	_
room	_
to	_
the	_
amazement	_
of	_
a	_
doddering	_
old	_
manservant	_
,	_
who	_
met	_
us	_
in	_
the	_
passage	_
.	_

There	_
was	_
no	_
light	_
save	_
in	_
the	_
dining	_
room	_
,	_
but	_
Holmes	_
caught	_
up	_
the	_
lamp	_
and	_
left	_
no	_
corner	_
of	_
the	_
house	_
unexplored	_
.	_

No	_
sign	_
could	_
we	_
see	_
of	_
the	_
man	_
whom	_
we	_
were	_
chasing	_
.	_

On	_
the	_
upper	_
floor	_
,	_
however	_
,	_
one	_
of	_
the	_
bedroom	_
doors	_
was	_
locked	_
.	_

``	_
There	_
's	_
someone	_
in	_
here	_
,	_
''	_
cried	_
Lestrade	_
.	_

``	_
I	_
can	_
hear	_
a	_
movement	_
.	_

Open	_
this	_
door	_
!	_
''	_

A	_
faint	_
moaning	_
and	_
rustling	_
came	_
from	_
within	_
.	_

Holmes	_
struck	_
the	_
door	_
just	_
over	_
the	_
lock	_
with	_
the	_
flat	_
of	_
his	_
foot	_
and	_
it	_
flew	_
open	_
.	_

Pistol	_
in	_
hand	_
,	_
we	_
all	_
three	_
rushed	_
into	_
the	_
room	_
.	_

But	_
there	_
was	_
no	_
sign	_
within	_
it	_
of	_
that	_
desperate	_
and	_
defiant	_
villain	_
whom	_
we	_
expected	_
to	_
see	_
.	_

Instead	_
we	_
were	_
faced	_
by	_
an	_
object	_
so	_
strange	_
and	_
so	_
unexpected	_
that	_
we	_
stood	_
for	_
a	_
moment	_
staring	_
at	_
it	_
in	_
amazement	_
.	_

The	_
room	_
had	_
been	_
fashioned	_
into	_
a	_
small	_
museum	_
,	_
and	_
the	_
walls	_
were	_
lined	_
by	_
a	_
number	_
of	_
glass	_
-	_
topped	_
cases	_
full	_
of	_
that	_
collection	_
of	_
butterflies	_
and	_
moths	_
the	_
formation	_
of	_
which	_
had	_
been	_
the	_
relaxation	_
of	_
this	_
complex	_
and	_
dangerous	_
man	_
.	_

In	_
the	_
centre	_
of	_
this	_
room	_
there	_
was	_
an	_
upright	_
beam	_
,	_
which	_
had	_
been	_
placed	_
at	_
some	_
period	_
as	_
a	_
support	_
for	_
the	_
old	_
worm-eaten	_
baulk	_
of	_
timber	_
which	_
spanned	_
the	_
roof	_
.	_

To	_
this	_
post	_
a	_
figure	_
was	_
tied	_
,	_
so	_
swathed	_
and	_
muffled	_
in	_
the	_
sheets	_
which	_
had	_
been	_
used	_
to	_
secure	_
it	_
that	_
one	_
could	_
not	_
for	_
the	_
moment	_
tell	_
whether	_
it	_
was	_
that	_
of	_
a	_
man	_
or	_
a	_
woman	_
.	_

One	_
towel	_
passed	_
round	_
the	_
throat	_
and	_
was	_
secured	_
at	_
the	_
back	_
of	_
the	_
pillar	_
.	_

Another	_
covered	_
the	_
lower	_
part	_
of	_
the	_
face	_
,	_
and	_
over	_
it	_
two	_
dark	_
eyes	_
--	_
eyes	_
full	_
of	_
grief	_
and	_
shame	_
and	_
a	_
dreadful	_
questioning	_
--	_
stared	_
back	_
at	_
us	_
.	_

In	_
a	_
minute	_
we	_
had	_
torn	_
off	_
the	_
gag	_
,	_
unswathed	_
the	_
bonds	_
,	_
and	_
Mrs	_
.	_
Stapleton	_
sank	_
upon	_
the	_
floor	_
in	_
front	_
of	_
us	_
.	_

As	_
her	_
beautiful	_
head	_
fell	_
upon	_
her	_
chest	_
I	_
saw	_
the	_
clear	_
red	_
weal	_
of	_
a	_
whiplash	_
across	_
her	_
neck	_
.	_

``	_
The	_
brute	_
!	_
''	_
cried	_
Holmes	_
.	_

``	_
Here	_
,	_
Lestrade	_
,	_
your	_
brandy	_
-	_
bottle	_
!	_

Put	_
her	_
in	_
the	_
chair	_
!	_

She	_
has	_
fainted	_
from	_
ill	_
-	_
usage	_
and	_
exhaustion	_
.	_
''	_

She	_
opened	_
her	_
eyes	_
again	_
.	_

``	_
Is	_
he	_
safe	_
?	_
''	_
she	_
asked	_
.	_

``	_
Has	_
he	_
escaped	_
?	_
''	_

``	_
He	_
can	_
not	_
escape	_
us	_
,	_
madam	_
.	_
''	_

``	_
No	_
,	_
no	_
,	_
I	_
did	_
not	_
mean	_
my	_
husband	_

Sir	_
Henry	_
?	_

Is	_
he	_
safe	_
?	_
''	_

``	_
Yes	_
.	_
''	_

``	_
And	_
the	_
hound	_
?	_
''	_

``	_
It	_
is	_
dead	_
.	_
''	_

She	_
gave	_
a	_
long	_
sigh	_
of	_
satisfaction	_
.	_

``	_
Thank	_
God	_
!	_

Thank	_
God	_
!	_

Oh	_
,	_
this	_
villain	_
!	_

See	_
how	_
he	_
has	_
treated	_
me	_
!	_
''	_

She	_
shot	_
her	_
arms	_
out	_
from	_
her	_
sleeves	_
,	_
and	_
we	_
saw	_
with	_
horror	_
that	_
they	_
were	_
all	_
mottled	_
with	_
bruises	_
.	_

``	_
But	_
this	_
is	_
nothing	_
--	_
nothing	_
!	_

It	_
is	_
my	_
mind	_
and	_
soul	_
that	_
he	_
has	_
tortured	_
and	_
defiled	_
.	_

I	_
could	_
endure	_
it	_
all	_
,	_
ill	_
-	_
usage	_
,	_
solitude	_
,	_
a	_
life	_
of	_
deception	_
,	_
everything	_
,	_
as	_
long	_
as	_
I	_
could	_
still	_
cling	_
to	_
the	_
hope	_
that	_
I	_
had	_
his	_
love	_
,	_
but	_
now	_
I	_
know	_
that	_
in	_
this	_
also	_
I	_
have	_
been	_
his	_
dupe	_
and	_
his	_
tool	_
.	_
''	_

She	_
broke	_
into	_
passionate	_

There	_
is	_

one	_
place	_
where	_
he	_
can	_
have	_
fled	_

''	_
she	_
answered	_

``	_
There	_
is	_
an	_
old	_
tin	_
mine	_
on	_
an	_
island	_
in	_
the	_
heart	_
of	_
the	_
mire	_
.	_

It	_
was	_
there	_
that	_
he	_
kept	_
his	_
hound	_
and	_
there	_
also	_
he	_
had	_
made	_
preparations	_
so	_
that	_
he	_
might	_
have	_
a	_
refuge	_
.	_

That	_
is	_
where	_
he	_
would	_
fly	_
.	_
''	_

The	_
fog	_
-	_
bank	_
lay	_
like	_
white	_
wool	_
against	_
the	_
window	_
.	_

Holmes	_
held	_
the	_
lamp	_
towards	_
it	_
.	_

``	_
See	_
,	_
''	_
said	_
he	_
.	_

``	_
No	_
one	_
could	_
find	_
his	_
way	_
into	_
the	_
Grimpen	_
Mire	_
tonight	_

''	_

She	_
laughed	_
and	_
clapped	_
her	_
hands	_
.	_

Her	_
eyes	_
and	_
teeth	_
gleamed	_
with	_
fierce	_
merriment	_
.	_

``	_
He	_
may	_
find	_
his	_
way	_
in	_
,	_
but	_
never	_
out	_

''	_
she	_
cried	_
.	_

``	_
How	_
can	_
he	_
see	_
the	_
guiding	_
wands	_
tonight	_
?	_

We	_
planted	_
them	_
together	_
,	_
he	_
and	_
I	_
,	_
to	_
mark	_
the	_
pathway	_
through	_
the	_
mire	_
.	_

Oh	_
,	_
if	_
I	_
could	_
only	_
have	_
plucked	_
them	_
out	_
today	_
.	_

Then	_
indeed	_
you	_
would	_
have	_
had	_
him	_
at	_
your	_
mercy	_
!	_
''	_

It	_
was	_
evident	_
to	_
us	_
that	_
all	_
pursuit	_
was	_
in	_
vain	_
until	_
the	_
fog	_
had	_
lifted	_
.	_

Meanwhile	_
we	_
left	_
Lestrade	_
in	_
possession	_
of	_
the	_
house	_
while	_
Holmes	_
and	_
I	_
went	_
back	_
with	_
the	_
baronet	_
to	_
Baskerville	_
Hall	_
.	_

The	_
story	_
of	_
the	_
Stapletons	_
could	_
no	_
longer	_
be	_
withheld	_
from	_
him	_
,	_
but	_
he	_
took	_
the	_
blow	_
bravely	_
when	_
he	_
learned	_
the	_
truth	_
about	_
the	_
woman	_
whom	_
he	_
had	_
loved	_
.	_

But	_
the	_
shock	_
of	_
the	_
night	_
's	_
adventures	_
had	_
shattered	_
his	_
nerves	_
,	_
and	_
before	_
morning	_
he	_
lay	_
delirious	_
in	_
a	_
high	_
fever	_
,	_
under	_
the	_
care	_
of	_
Dr	_
.	_
Mortimer	_
.	_

The	_
two	_
of	_
them	_
were	_
destined	_
to	_
travel	_
together	_
round	_
the	_
world	_
before	_
Sir	_
Henry	_
had	_
become	_
once	_
more	_
the	_
hale	_
,	_
hearty	_
man	_
that	_
he	_
had	_
been	_
before	_
he	_
became	_
master	_
of	_
that	_
ill	_
-	_
omened	_
estate	_
.	_

And	_
now	_
I	_
come	_
rapidly	_
to	_
the	_
conclusion	_
of	_
this	_
singular	_
narrative	_
,	_
in	_
which	_
I	_
have	_
tried	_
to	_
make	_
the	_
reader	_
share	_
those	_
dark	_
fears	_
and	_
vague	_
surmises	_
which	_
clouded	_
our	_
lives	_
so	_
long	_
and	_
ended	_
in	_
so	_
tragic	_
a	_
manner	_
.	_

On	_
the	_
morning	_
after	_
the	_
death	_
of	_
the	_
hound	_
the	_
fog	_
had	_
lifted	_
and	_
we	_
were	_
guided	_
by	_
Mrs	_
.	_
Stapleton	_
to	_
the	_
point	_
where	_
they	_
had	_
found	_
a	_
pathway	_
through	_
the	_
bog	_
.	_

It	_
helped	_
us	_
to	_
realize	_
the	_
horror	_
of	_
this	_
woman	_
's	_
life	_
when	_
we	_
saw	_
the	_
eagerness	_
and	_
joy	_
with	_
which	_
she	_
laid	_
us	_
on	_
her	_
husband	_
's	_
track	_
.	_

We	_
left	_
her	_
standing	_
upon	_
the	_
thin	_
peninsula	_
of	_
firm	_
,	_
peaty	_
soil	_
which	_
tapered	_
out	_
into	_
the	_
widespread	_
bog	_
.	_

From	_
the	_
end	_
of	_
it	_
a	_
small	_
wand	_
planted	_
here	_
and	_
there	_
showed	_
where	_
the	_
path	_
zigzagged	_
from	_
tuft	_
to	_
tuft	_
of	_
rushes	_
among	_
those	_
green-scummed	_
pits	_
and	_
foul	_
quagmires	_
which	_
barred	_
the	_
way	_
to	_
the	_
stranger	_
.	_

Rank	_
reeds	_
and	_
lush	_
,	_
slimy	_
water	_
-	_
plants	_
sent	_
an	_
odour	_
of	_
decay	_
and	_
a	_
heavy	_
miasmatic	_
vapour	_
onto	_
our	_
faces	_
,	_
while	_
a	_
false	_
step	_
plunged	_
us	_
more	_
than	_
once	_
thigh-deep	_
into	_
the	_
dark	_
,	_
quivering	_
mire	_
,	_
which	_
shook	_
for	_
yards	_
in	_
soft	_
undulations	_
around	_
our	_
feet	_
.	_

Its	_
tenacious	_
grip	_
plucked	_
at	_
our	_
heels	_
as	_
we	_
walked	_
,	_
and	_
when	_
we	_
sank	_
into	_
it	_
it	_
was	_
as	_
if	_
some	_
malignant	_
hand	_
was	_
tugging	_
us	_
down	_
into	_
those	_
obscene	_
depths	_
,	_
so	_
grim	_
and	_
purposeful	_
was	_
the	_
clutch	_
in	_
which	_
it	_
held	_
us	_
.	_

Once	_
only	_
we	_
saw	_
a	_
trace	_
that	_
someone	_
had	_
passed	_
that	_
perilous	_
way	_
before	_
us	_
.	_

From	_
amid	_
a	_
tuft	_
of	_
cotton	_
grass	_
which	_
bore	_
it	_
up	_
out	_
of	_
the	_
slime	_
some	_
dark	_
thing	_
was	_
projecting	_
.	_

Holmes	_
sank	_
to	_
his	_
waist	_
as	_
he	_
stepped	_
from	_
the	_
path	_
to	_
seize	_
it	_
,	_
and	_
had	_
we	_
not	_
been	_
there	_
to	_
drag	_
him	_
out	_
he	_
could	_
never	_
have	_
set	_
his	_
foot	_
upon	_
firm	_
land	_
again	_
.	_

He	_
held	_
an	_
old	_
black	_
boot	_
in	_
the	_
air	_
.	_

``	_
Meyers	_
,	_
Toronto	_
,	_
''	_
was	_
printed	_
on	_
the	_
leather	_
inside	_
.	_

``	_
It	_
is	_
worth	_
a	_
mud	_
bath	_
,	_
''	_
said	_
he	_
.	_

``	_
It	_
is	_
our	_
friend	_
Sir	_
Henry	_
's	_
missing	_
boot	_
.	_
''	_

``	_
Thrown	_
there	_
by	_
Stapleton	_
in	_
his	_
flight	_
.	_
''	_

``	_
Exactly	_
.	_

He	_
retained	_
it	_
in	_
his	_
hand	_
after	_
using	_
it	_
to	_
set	_
the	_
hound	_
upon	_
the	_
track	_
.	_

He	_
fled	_
when	_
he	_
knew	_
the	_
game	_
was	_
up	_
,	_
still	_
clutching	_
it	_
.	_

And	_
he	_
hurled	_
it	_
away	_
at	_
this	_
point	_
of	_
his	_
flight	_
.	_

We	_
know	_
at	_
least	_
that	_
he	_
came	_
so	_
far	_
in	_
safety	_
.	_
''	_

But	_
more	_
than	_
that	_
we	_
were	_
never	_
destined	_
to	_
know	_
,	_
though	_
there	_
was	_
much	_
which	_
we	_
might	_
surmise	_
.	_

There	_
was	_
no	_
chance	_
of	_
finding	_
footsteps	_
in	_
the	_
mire	_
,	_
for	_
the	_
rising	_
mud	_
oozed	_
swiftly	_
in	_
upon	_
them	_
,	_
but	_
as	_
we	_
at	_
last	_
reached	_
firmer	_
ground	_
beyond	_
the	_
morass	_
we	_
all	_
looked	_
eagerly	_
for	_
them	_
.	_

But	_
no	_
slightest	_
sign	_
of	_
them	_
ever	_
met	_
our	_
eyes	_
.	_

If	_
the	_
earth	_
told	_
a	_
true	_
story	_
,	_
then	_
Stapleton	_
never	_
reached	_
that	_
island	_
of	_
refuge	_
towards	_
which	_
he	_
struggled	_
through	_
the	_
fog	_
upon	_
that	_
last	_
night	_
.	_

Somewhere	_
in	_
the	_
heart	_
of	_
the	_
great	_
Grimpen	_
Mire	_
,	_
down	_
in	_
the	_
foul	_
slime	_
of	_
the	_
huge	_
morass	_
which	_
had	_
sucked	_
him	_
in	_
,	_
this	_
cold	_
and	_
cruel	_
-	_
hearted	_
man	_
is	_
forever	_
buried	_
.	_

Many	_
traces	_
we	_
found	_
of	_
him	_
in	_
the	_
bog	_
-	_
girt	_
island	_
where	_
he	_
had	_
hid	_
his	_
savage	_
ally	_
.	_

A	_
huge	_
driving	_
-	_
wheel	_
and	_
a	_
shaft	_
half	_
-	_
filled	_
with	_
rubbish	_
showed	_
the	_
position	_
of	_
an	_
abandoned	_
mine	_
.	_

Beside	_
it	_
were	_
the	_
crumbling	_
remains	_
of	_
the	_
cottages	_
of	_
the	_
miners	_
,	_
driven	_
away	_
no	_
doubt	_
by	_
the	_
foul	_
reek	_
of	_
the	_
surrounding	_
swamp	_
.	_

In	_
one	_
of	_
these	_
a	_
staple	_
and	_
chain	_
with	_
a	_
quantity	_
of	_
gnawed	_
bones	_
showed	_
where	_
the	_
animal	_
had	_
been	_
confined	_
.	_

A	_
skeleton	_
with	_
a	_
tangle	_
of	_
brown	_
hair	_
adhering	_
to	_
it	_
lay	_
among	_
the	_
debris	_
.	_

``	_
A	_
dog	_
!	_
''	_
said	_
Holmes	_
.	_

``	_
By	_
Jove	_
,	_
a	_
curly	_
-	_
haired	_
spaniel	_
.	_

Poor	_
Mortimer	_
will	_
never	_
see	_
his	_
pet	_
again	_
.	_

Well	_
,	_
I	_
do	_
not	_
know	_
that	_
this	_
place	_
contains	_
any	_
secret	_
which	_
we	_
have	_
not	_
already	_
fathomed	_
.	_

He	_
could	_
hide	_
his	_
hound	_
,	_
but	_
he	_
could	_
not	_
hush	_
its	_
voice	_
,	_
and	_
hence	_
came	_
those	_
cries	_
which	_
even	_
in	_
daylight	_
were	_
not	_
pleasant	_
to	_
hear	_
.	_

On	_
an	_
emergency	_
he	_
could	_
keep	_
the	_
hound	_
in	_
the	_
outhouse	_
at	_
Merripit	_
,	_
but	_
it	_
was	_
always	_
a	_
risk	_
,	_
and	_
it	_
was	_
only	_
on	_
the	_
supreme	_
day	_
,	_
which	_
he	_
regarded	_
as	_
the	_
end	_
of	_
all	_
his	_
efforts	_
,	_
that	_
he	_
dared	_
do	_
it	_
.	_

This	_
paste	_
in	_
the	_
tin	_
is	_
no	_
doubt	_
the	_
luminous	_
mixture	_
with	_
which	_
the	_
creature	_
was	_
daubed	_
.	_

It	_
was	_
suggested	_
,	_
of	_
course	_
,	_
by	_
the	_
story	_
of	_
the	_
family	_
hell	_
-	_
hound	_
,	_
and	_
by	_
the	_
desire	_
to	_
frighten	_
old	_
Sir	_
Charles	_
to	_
death	_
.	_

No	_
wonder	_
the	_
poor	_
devil	_
of	_
a	_
convict	_
ran	_
and	_
screamed	_
,	_
even	_
as	_
our	_
friend	_
did	_
,	_
and	_
as	_
we	_
ourselves	_
might	_
have	_
done	_
,	_
when	_
he	_
saw	_
such	_
a	_
creature	_
bounding	_
through	_
the	_
darkness	_
of	_
the	_
moor	_
upon	_
his	_
track	_
.	_

It	_
was	_
a	_
cunning	_
device	_
,	_
for	_
,	_
apart	_
from	_
the	_
chance	_
of	_
driving	_
your	_
victim	_
to	_
his	_
death	_
,	_
what	_
peasant	_
would	_
venture	_
to	_
inquire	_
too	_
closely	_
into	_
such	_
a	_
creature	_
should	_
he	_
get	_
sight	_
of	_
it	_
,	_
as	_
many	_
have	_
done	_
,	_
upon	_
the	_
moor	_
?	_

I	_
said	_

in	_
London	_
,	_
Watson	_
,	_
and	_
I	_
say	_
it	_
again	_
now	_
,	_
that	_
never	_
yet	_
have	_
we	_
helped	_
to	_
hunt	_
down	_

man	_

History	_

Syria	_
signed	TARGET
the	_
Nuclear	TARGET
Non	_
-	_
Proliferation	_
Treaty	TARGET
(	_
NPT	_
)	_
in	_
1969	_
.	_

It	_
took	_
this	_
step	TARGET
to	_
obtain	TARGET
the	_
political	_
and	_
technical	_
benefits	_
that	_
come	_
from	_
signing	TARGET
the	_
treaty	_
.	_

In	_
the	_
aftermath	_
of	_
its	_
losses	TARGET
in	_
the	_
Six	_
Day	_
War	_
,	_
Syria	_
felt	TARGET
that	_
it	_
needed	TARGET
broader	TARGET
support	_
from	_
the	_
international	TARGET
community	TARGET
to	_
guard	_
against	_
Israeli	_
acts	TARGET
of	_
aggression	_
.	_

Additionally	_
,	_
the	_
government	TARGET
wanted	TARGET
to	_
take	_
advantage	_
of	_
technical	_
assistance	TARGET
from	_
the	_
IAEA	_
and	_
its	_
member	TARGET
states	TARGET
that	_
is	_
only	_
available	_
after	TARGET
a	_
state	TARGET
signs	TARGET
the	_
NPT	_
.	_

In	_
1979	_
,	_
Syria	_
established	TARGET
its	_
Atomic	_
Energy	_
Commission	_
(	_
AECS	_
)	_
largely	_
to	_
manage	_
IAEA	_
assistance	TARGET
programs	TARGET
and	_
to	_
plan	TARGET
for	_
the	_
eventual	_
development	TARGET
of	_
a	_
nuclear	_
power	TARGET
program	TARGET
.	_

In	_
1983	_
,	_
the	_
IAEA	_
assisted	TARGET
Syria	_
in	_
establishing	TARGET
an	_
analytical	_
laboratory	TARGET
that	_
was	_
equipped	TARGET
with	_
systems	TARGET
for	_
atomic	_
spectrometry	_
and	_
various	_
other	_
experiments	_
.	_

Five	TARGET
Syrian	_
scientists	TARGET
were	_
trained	TARGET
in	_
Hungary	_
,	_
the	_
United	_
States	_
,	_
Yugoslavia	_
,	_
and	_
Austria	_
as	_
a	_
part	TARGET
of	_
the	_
project	TARGET
.	_

Also	_
in	_
1983	_
,	_
Syrian	_
and	_
Soviet	_
scientists	TARGET
carried	TARGET
out	_
a	_
joint	_
study	TARGET
on	_
the	_
construction	TARGET
of	_
a	_
nuclear	_
power	TARGET
reactor	TARGET
in	TARGET
Syria	_
.	_

This	_
study	TARGET
was	_
part	TARGET
of	_
an	_
IAEA	_
cooperative	_
assistance	TARGET
project	TARGET
to	_
help	TARGET
Syria	_
understand	TARGET
the	_
requirements	TARGET
for	_
developing	TARGET
and	_
maintaining	TARGET
a	_
nuclear	_
program	TARGET
.	_

Although	_
Syria	_
has	_
probably	_
never	_
attempted	TARGET
to	_
indigenously	_
build	TARGET
nuclear	_
weapons	_
,	_
there	_
have	_
been	TARGET
rumors	TARGET
that	_
it	_
might	_
be	_
interested	TARGET
in	_
obtaining	TARGET
such	_
weapons	_
to	_
deter	_
an	_
Israeli	_
nuclear	_
weapons	TARGET
threat	TARGET
.	_

In	_
fact	_
,	_
in	_
1986	_
,	_
when	_
questioned	TARGET
on	_
his	_
opinion	_
of	_
the	_
Israeli	_
nuclear	_
arsenal	_
,	_
Syrian	_
Chief	_
of	_
Staff	_
General	_
Hihmet	_
Al-Siabi	_
suggested	TARGET
that	_
Syria	_
would	_
strive	_
to	_
achieve	TARGET
strategic	_
equality	_
with	_
Israel	_
including	TARGET
nuclear	TARGET
parity	_
.	_

In	_
the	_
late	TARGET
1980s	_
and	_
early	TARGET
1990s	_
,	_
Syria	_
began	TARGET
exploring	_
its	_
potential	TARGET
for	_
indigenous	TARGET
nuclear	TARGET
resources	_
.	_

Upon	_
completion	TARGET
of	_
several	TARGET
uranium	TARGET
exploration	_
projects	TARGET
,	_
Syria	_
began	TARGET
experiments	_
to	_
extract	TARGET
uranium	TARGET
from	_
its	_
vast	_
phosphoric	_
rock	_
reserves	TARGET
.	_

In	_
1986	_
,	_
the	_
IAEA	_
and	_
AECS	_
constructed	TARGET
a	_
micro	_
-	_
plant	_
at	_
the	_
General	_
Phosphate	_
Company	_
Plant	_
in	_
Homs	_
to	_
study	TARGET
the	_
process	TARGET
of	_
uranium	TARGET
extraction	TARGET
from	_
phosphoric	_
acid	_
.	_

The	_
plant	TARGET
would	_
be	_
the	_
forerunner	_
to	_
a	_
commercial	_
plant	TARGET
if	_
Syria	_
obtained	TARGET
a	_
nuclear	_
power	TARGET
reactor	TARGET
and	_
needed	TARGET
fresh	TARGET
fuel	_
regularly	_
.	_

In	_
1996	_
,	_
Syria	_
began	TARGET
developing	_
a	_
plant	TARGET
to	_
recover	_
uranium	TARGET
from	_
tri	_
-superphosphates	_
using	TARGET
a	_
similar	TARGET
technology	TARGET
.	_

That	_
facility	TARGET
came	_
online	_
in	_
2001	_
.	_

In	_
1991	_
,	_
China	_
started	TARGET
constructing	TARGET
Syria	_
's	_

,	_
a	_

located	TARGET
at	_
the	_
Der	_
Al-Hadjar	_
Nuclear	_
Research	_

China	_
provided	TARGET

approximately	_
980	_
grams	TARGET
of	_
89%	_
enriched	TARGET
U235	_
to	_
operate	TARGET
the	_
reactor	TARGET
.	_

That	_
facility	TARGET
went	TARGET
critical	TARGET
in	_
1996	_
and	_
become	TARGET
fully	_
operational	TARGET
in	_
1998	_
.	_

The	_
MNSR	_
gives	TARGET
Syria	_
the	_
capability	TARGET
to	_
produce	TARGET
neutrons	_
for	_
nuclear	TARGET
analysis	TARGET
,	_
isotopes	_
for	_
industrial	TARGET
applications	TARGET
,	_
and	_
radioisotopes	_
for	_
training	TARGET
purposes	TARGET
,	_
but	_
is	_
unsuitable	TARGET
for	_
weapons	TARGET
production	TARGET
.	_

In	_
1997	_
,	_
the	_
IAEA	_
approved	TARGET
a	_
technical	_
assistance	TARGET
project	TARGET
to	_
provide	TARGET
Syria	_
with	_
a	_
cyclotron	_
facility	TARGET
.	_

It	_
was	_
to	_
be	_
built	TARGET
at	TARGET
the	_
Nuclear	_
Medicine	TARGET
Centre	_
in	TARGET
Damascus	_

The	_
Cyclon-30	_
cyclotron	_
,	_
provided	TARGET
by	_
Belgium	_
's	_
Ion	_
Beam	_
Applications	_
,	_
is	_
the	_

model	_
as	_
the	_
cyclotron	_
in	TARGET
Iran	_
,	_
where	_
it	_
is	_
suspected	TARGET
of	_
being	_
used	TARGET
to	_
enrich	TARGET
uranium	TARGET
.	_

The	_
facility	TARGET
's	_
status	_
is	_
unknown	TARGET
.	_

In	_
more	TARGET
recent	_
years	TARGET
,	_
Syria	_
has	_
continued	TARGET
to	_
develop	TARGET
its	_
nuclear	TARGET
research	TARGET
facilities	TARGET
and	_
other	TARGET
facilities	TARGET
to	_
help	TARGET
manage	_
its	_
nuclear	TARGET
material	TARGET
.	_

The	_
government	TARGET
has	_
also	_
entered	_
into	_
new	TARGET
cooperation	TARGET
agreements	TARGET
with	_
several	TARGET
countries	TARGET
,	_
most	_

In	_

Part	TARGET

,	_
with	_

However	_
,	_
there	_
are	TARGET
a	_
number	TARGET

The	_

has	_
allegedly	TARGET
taken	_
in	_
Iraqi	_
scientists	TARGET
prior	TARGET
to	_
the	_
recent	TARGET
Gulf	_
War	TARGET
.	_

In	_
December	TARGET
2002	_
,	_
an	_
Italian	TARGET
newspaper	TARGET
cited	TARGET
an	_
Iraqi	TARGET
officer	_
who	_
asserted	TARGET
that	_
Syria	_

Iraq	_
to	_
store	TARGET
its	_
weapons	TARGET
of	_
mass	_
destruction	_
in	TARGET
Syria	_
research	TARGET
centers	TARGET
.	_

These	_
allegations	TARGET
were	_
never	_
confirmed	TARGET
.	_

In	_
2003	_
,	_
Russian	TARGET
and	_
Syrian	TARGET
officials	TARGET
continued	TARGET
their	_
negotiations	TARGET
for	_
the	_
construction	TARGET

a	_
nuclear	TARGET

that	_
would	_
include	TARGET
a	_
nuclear	_
power	TARGET
plant	TARGET
and	_
a	_
seawater	_

Open	TARGET

reported	TARGET
that	_
the	_
Russian	TARGET
Minister	TARGET

confirmed	TARGET
that	_
discussions	TARGET

Syria	_
's	_
quest	TARGET
