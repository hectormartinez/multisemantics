Dear	_
Mailhouse	_
donor	TARGET
reminder	TARGET
:	_

You	_
and	_
I	_
have	_
done	TARGET
some	TARGET
important	TARGET
work	TARGET
together	TARGET
.	_

We	_
've	_
helped	TARGET
people	TARGET
break	_
free	_
of	_
the	_
welfare	_
cycle	_
.	_

We	_
've	_
found	TARGET
ways	TARGET
for	_
people	TARGET
with	_
disabilities	_
to	_
enter	TARGET
the	_
workforce	_
.	_

We	_
've	_
expanded	TARGET
Goodwill	_
's	_
proven	TARGET
methods	TARGET
to	_
towns	TARGET
and	_
neighborhoods	_
where	TARGET
they	_
are	_
needed	TARGET
most	_
.	_

Of	_
course	_
,	_
we	_
've	_
played	TARGET
different	TARGET
roles	TARGET
.	_

You	_
have	_
helped	TARGET
make	TARGET
Goodwill	_
's	_
work	TARGET
possible	TARGET
with	_
your	_
previous	TARGET
support	_
.	_

Goodwill	_
has	_
devised	TARGET
the	_
programs	TARGET
that	_
turned	TARGET
your	_
investment	_
into	_
results	TARGET
.	_

Who	_
has	_
benefited	_
from	_
our	_
partnership	_
?	_

Everyone	_
has	_
.	_

When	TARGET
you	_
and	_
I	_
help	TARGET
somebody	_
find	TARGET
a	_
job	TARGET
,	_
one	TARGET
more	TARGET
person	TARGET
joins	TARGET
the	_
ranks	_
of	_
tax	_
payers	_
,	_
fewer	_
tax	_
dollars	_
are	_
spent	_
on	_
public	_
assistance	TARGET
and	_
businesses	TARGET
gain	TARGET
another	TARGET
consumer	_
.	_

There	_
are	TARGET
a	_
lot	TARGET
of	_
barriers	_
that	_
keep	_
people	TARGET
from	_
working	TARGET
:	_
physical	_
and	_
mental	_
disabilities	_
,	_
history	TARGET
of	_
welfare	_
dependency	TARGET
and	_
lack	TARGET
of	_
education	TARGET
or	_
self-esteem	_
.	_

And	_
there	_
are	TARGET
a	_
lot	TARGET
of	_
people	TARGET
who	_
face	TARGET
these	_
challenges	TARGET
every	TARGET
day	TARGET
of	TARGET
their	_
lives	_
.	_

So	_
our	_
work	TARGET
must	TARGET
continue	TARGET
.	_

Everyone	_
benefits	_
from	_
the	_
work	TARGET
we	_
do	TARGET
together	TARGET
.	_

Many	TARGET
people	TARGET
need	TARGET
our	_
help	TARGET
.	_

Please	_
continue	TARGET
our	_
important	TARGET

Support	TARGET
Goodwill	_
with	_

Dear	_
Joe	_
,	_

I	_
know	_
what	_
you	_
mean	_
about	_
being	_
a	_
journalist	_
.	_

Almost	TARGET
every	_
assignment	_
is	_
a	_
challenge	TARGET
in	_
a	_
different	TARGET
way	TARGET
and	_
it	_
never	TARGET
seems	TARGET
to	_
get	TARGET
easier	TARGET
.	_

I	_
often	TARGET
feel	TARGET
as	_
if	_
I	_
only	_
get	TARGET
half	TARGET
the	_
story	_
sometimes	TARGET
,	_
so	_
I	_
typically	_
do	TARGET
a	_
massive	_
amount	TARGET
of	_
reporting	_
that	_
is	_
most	_
often	TARGET
much	_
more	_
than	_
I	_
will	_
ever	_
need	TARGET
.	_

I	_
think	TARGET
that	_
is	_
why	_
I	_
welcomed	_
doing	TARGET
a	_
book	TARGET
--	_
it	_
gives	TARGET
one	_
the	_
ability	TARGET
to	_
use	TARGET
so	_
much	_
of	_
what	_
is	_
left	_
on	_
the	_
cutting	_
room	TARGET
floor	TARGET
of	_
daily	TARGET
journalism	_
.	_

Think	TARGET
of	_
all	_
the	_
good	TARGET
stuff	_
we	_
all	_
collect	TARGET
daily	_
in	_
our	_
reporting	_
that	_
we	_
never	TARGET
add	_
to	_
stories	_
.	_

Most	_
often	TARGET
reporters	_
recount	TARGET
these	_
tales	_
with	_
each	_
other	_
and	_
with	_
their	_
sources	TARGET
rather	_
than	_
share	_
them	_
with	_
the	_
general	_
public	_
.	_

Much	TARGET
of	_
it	_
,	_
of	_
course	_
,	_
using	TARGET
the	_
standards	_
of	_
top	TARGET
newspapers	TARGET
,	_
can	TARGET
not	_
be	_
used	TARGET
since	TARGET
it	_
is	_
largely	_
gossip	TARGET
we	_
are	_
repeating	_
,	_
although	_
it	_
certainly	TARGET
could	TARGET
make	_
for	_
some	TARGET
very	_
good	TARGET
stories	_
.	_

I	_
often	TARGET
wonder	TARGET
when	TARGET
a	_
really	_
great	TARGET
fictional	_
book	TARGET
will	_
be	_
written	TARGET
about	TARGET
this	_
era	TARGET
(	_
probably	TARGET
decades	TARGET
and	_
decades	TARGET
hence	TARGET
as	_
it	_
is	_
too	_
close	_
)	_
.	_

In	_
any	_
case	TARGET
,	_
there	_
certainly	TARGET
is	TARGET
no	_
lack	TARGET
of	_
information	TARGET
available	_
about	TARGET
the	_
moguls	TARGET
of	_
technology	TARGET
now	TARGET
as	_
they	_
all	_
become	TARGET
our	_
current	TARGET
pop	_
icons	_
.	_

I	_
would	_
posit	_
that	_
Bill	_
and	_
Michael	_
and	_
Steve	_
and	_
Jerry	_
have	_
become	TARGET
the	_
Madonnas	_
of	_
the	_
current	TARGET
age	TARGET
of	_
stock	_
market	_
mania	_
and	_
celebration	_
of	_
the	_
entrepreneur	_
.	_

So	_
the	_
shift	TARGET
in	_
the	_
image	_
of	_
Gates	_
has	_
been	_
an	_
interesting	TARGET
one	_
for	_
me	_
to	_
watch	TARGET
.	_

The	_
smart-boy	_
technologist	_
is	_
now	TARGET
being	_
painted	TARGET
as	_
the	_
whiny	_
bully	_
.	_

I	_
personally	_
always	TARGET
thought	TARGET
it	_
was	_
a	_
risk	TARGET
to	_
pin	TARGET
the	_
image	_
of	_
Microsoft	_
on	_
just	_
one	TARGET
man	TARGET
--	_
at	TARGET
AOL	_
,	_
for	_
example	TARGET
,	_
there	_
was	TARGET
a	_
conscious	TARGET
effort	TARGET
to	_
develop	TARGET
other	TARGET
``	_
characters	_
,	_
''	_
for	_
lack	TARGET
of	_
a	_
better	TARGET
word	TARGET
.	_

So	_
there	TARGET
,	_
while	TARGET
you	_
think	TARGET
of	_
Case	_
,	_
you	_
also	_
think	TARGET
of	_
Pittman	_
and	_
Leonsis	_
and	_
increasingly	TARGET
a	_
range	TARGET
of	_
other	TARGET
executives	_
.	_

Steve	_
Ballmer	_
,	_
of	_
course	_
,	_
is	_
now	TARGET
getting	TARGET
a	_
lot	TARGET
more	TARGET
attention	TARGET
at	TARGET
Microsoft	_
,	_
but	_
it	_
still	TARGET
seems	TARGET
to	_
be	_
Bill	_
's	_
show	_
over	_
there	TARGET
.	_

While	_
I	_
did	_
not	_
attend	_
the	_
trial	TARGET
--	_
I	_
was	_
lucky	TARGET
to	_
be	_
able	TARGET
to	_
read	TARGET
your	_
highly	_
amusing	TARGET
and	_
informative	_
dispatches	_
,	_
several	TARGET
of	TARGET
which	_
made	TARGET
me	_
spit	TARGET
up	_
my	_
lunch	_
laughing	TARGET
--	_
it	_
certainly	TARGET
seemed	TARGET
as	_
if	_
the	_
image	_
of	_
Bill	_
Gates	_
took	_
a	_
beating	_
and	_
the	_
insular	_
culture	_
of	_
Microsoft	_
did	_
not	_
look	TARGET
so	TARGET
good	TARGET
.	_

That	_
's	_
ironic	_
,	_
since	TARGET
I	_
think	TARGET
it	_
was	_
just	_
that	_
insularity	_
that	_
helped	TARGET
them	_
,	_
much	_
in	_
the	_
same	TARGET
way	_
that	_
AOL	_
has	_
benefited	_
from	_
being	_
in	TARGET
the	_
Virginia	_
suburbs	_
rather	_
than	_
in	TARGET
Silicon	_
Valley	TARGET
.	_

AOL	_
would	_
never	TARGET
have	_
existed	TARGET
if	_
it	_
had	_
been	_
founded	TARGET
here	TARGET
,	_
I	_
am	_
sure	TARGET
,	_
since	TARGET
its	_
employees	TARGET
would	_
have	_
been	_
mocked	TARGET
into	_
obscurity	_
by	_
the	_
digerati	_
.	_

Out	_
in	TARGET
the	_
D.C.	_
area	TARGET
,	_
they	_
looked	TARGET
positively	_
exciting	TARGET
next	_
to	TARGET
all	TARGET
the	_
government-oriented	_
contractors	_
.	_

I	_
wonder	TARGET
if	_
that	_
means	TARGET
geography	_
is	_
destiny	TARGET
,	_
and	_
it	_
's	_
still	TARGET
location	TARGET
,	_
location	TARGET
,	_
location	TARGET
.	_

From	_
where	TARGET
I	_
am	_
sitting	TARGET
,	_
I	_
think	TARGET
the	_
Microsoft	_
trial	TARGET
has	_
been	_
the	_
really	_
obvious	TARGET
turning	_
point	_
between	TARGET
the	_
computer	_
era	TARGET
and	_
the	_
digital	_
age	TARGET
.	_

I	_
think	TARGET
it	_
almost	_
does	_
not	_
matter	_
what	_
the	_
judge	_
does	TARGET
since	TARGET
it	_
's	_
clear	TARGET
that	_
the	_
balance	_
of	_
power	TARGET
is	_
shifting	TARGET
again	_
,	_
although	_
it	_
not	_
clear	TARGET
where	TARGET
it	_
will	_
land	_
.	_

Will	_
the	_
strongman	TARGET
of	_
the	_
era	TARGET
be	_
AOL	_
,	_
AT	_
and	_
T	_
,	_
Microsoft	_
,	_
or	_
one	TARGET
of	TARGET
the	_
big	_
media	_
companies	TARGET
?	_

Or	_
will	_
it	_
be	_
none	_
of	TARGET
them	_
because	TARGET
the	_
Internet	_
allows	TARGET
and	_
encourages	TARGET
a	_
plethora	TARGET
of	_
strong	TARGET
companies	TARGET
and	_
a	_
complex	_
interconnection	_
of	_
businesses	TARGET
where	_
none	_
are	_
allowed	TARGET
to	_
dominate	TARGET
?	_

I	_
always	TARGET
use	TARGET
two	TARGET
simple	_
words	TARGET
when	TARGET
people	TARGET
tell	TARGET
me	_
that	_
one	TARGET
company	TARGET
--	_
whether	_
it	_
is	_
AOL	_
or	_
Microsoft	_
or	_
Disney	_
--	_
is	_
in	_
charge	TARGET
of	_
all	_
our	_
destinies	TARGET
:	_
Babylon	_
was	TARGET
.	_

That	_
incredible	TARGET
empire	TARGET
dominated	TARGET
the	_
world	TARGET
and	_
I	_
imagine	TARGET
it	_
did	_
not	_
seem	TARGET
possible	TARGET
to	_
people	TARGET
living	TARGET
then	TARGET
that	_
anyone	_
could	TARGET
loosen	_
that	_
empire	TARGET
's	_
grip	_
on	_
humanity	_
.	_

But	_
we	_
all	_
know	TARGET
how	_
that	_
story	_
turned	_
out	_
.	_

Now	TARGET
I	_
am	_
getting	TARGET
way	_
too	TARGET
philosophical	_
,	_
but	_
this	_
is	_
my	_
final	TARGET
missive	TARGET
,	_
so	_
why	_
not	_
?	_

Perhaps	_
you	_
could	TARGET
hasten	TARGET
a	_
prediction	TARGET
of	_
where	TARGET
this	_
is	_
all	_
going	TARGET
.	_

As	_
for	_
me	_
,	_
I	_
'll	_
stick	_
with	_
my	_
philosophy	_
of	_
reporting	_
and	_
,	_
I	_
guess	TARGET
,	_

nobody	_

Fifth	_
:	_
Advice	_

A-	_
Maintain	_
provision	_
of	_
legitimate	_
justice	_
,	_
and	_
justice	_
is	_
the	_
establishing	_
the	_
human	_
's	_
behavior	_
in	_
religion	_
.	_

Two	_
points	_
are	_
considered:	_

1-Piety	_
in	_
religion	_
:	_
Perform	_
religious	_
duties	_
according	_
to	_
certain	_
supererogatory	_
exercises	_
of	_
devotion	_
.	_

Avoid	_
the	_
forbidden	_
,	_
one	_
should	_
abstain	_
from	_
great	_
or	_
minor	_
sins	_
.	_

2-Practising	_
chivalry	_
:	_
One	_
should	_
adopt	_
whatever	_
makes	_
him	_
look	_
good	_
and	_
avoid	_
what	_
degrades	_
him.	_
(	_
T.C	_
:	_
Koranic	_
verse	_
)	_
,	_
(	_
Abu	_
Aldara	_
'	_
)	_
.	_

B-	_
Exert	_
your	_
utmost	_
and	_
every	_
conceivable	_
effort	_
for	_
the	_
sake	_
of	_
achieving	_
the	_
rightful	_
objectives	_
of	_
ALQAEDA	_
.	_
(	_
T.C	_
:	_
Koranic	_
verse	_
)	_

The	_
sign	_
of	_
truth	_
is	_
:	_
1-Your	_
effort	_
in	_
serving	_
your	_
religion	_
is	_
greater	_
than	_
the	_
effort	_
exerted	_
in	_
your	_
worldly	_
matters	_
and	_
your	_
family.	_
(	_
T.C	_
:	_
Koranic	_
verse	_
)	_
,	_
(	_
Albukhari	_
)	_
.	_

2-Your	_
effort	_
in	_
serving	_
your	_
religion	_
should	_
be	_
greater	_
than	_
the	_
effort	_
exerted	_
by	_
the	_
infidels	_
to	_
support	_
their	_
lies	_
.	_

C-	_
Thorough	_
study	_
of	_

curricula	_
,	_
and	_

time	_
in	_
doing	_
this	_

thereby	_
providing	_
the	_
Muslim	_
brother	_
with	_
an	_
Islamic	_
vision	_
for	_
contemporary	_
events	_
.	_

Knowledge	_
without	_
work	_
is	_
a	_
burden	_
on	_
the	_
person	_
,	_
and	_
knowledge	_
without	_
work	_
is	_
useless	_
.	_

D-	_
If	_
you	_
are	_
a	_
specialist	_
in	_
any	_
field	_
,	_
then	_
you	_
have	_
to	_
master	_
your	_
specialization	_
.	_

If	_
you	_
could	_
serve	_
the	_
objectives	_
of	_
AL-QAEDA	_
through	_
your	_
specialization	_
,	_
than	_
inform	_
your	_
leadership	_
of	_
that	_
.	_

E-	_
The	_
brethren	_
are	_
advised	_
to	_
avoid	_
disagreement	_
and	_
argument	_
in	_
religion	_
,	_
discussing	_
religion	_
without	_
proper	_
knowledge	_
is	_
prohibited	_
,	_
and	_
questions	_
of	_
differences	_
are	_
referred	_
to	_
powerful	_
knowledgeable	_
leaders.	_

the	_

really	_

that	_

talk	TARGET

about	_
the	_
fact	_
that	_
our-	_
we	_
're	_
a	_

better	TARGET

eighty	_

ninety	_

going	_

we	_

Uh	_
let	_
's	_
talk	TARGET
about	_
the	_
other	TARGET
(	_
(	_
problem	_

of	_
the	_

the	_

Here	_

Dr	_

But	_
we	_
only	_
know	TARGET

laboratory	TARGET

studies	TARGET
uh	_
uh	_
in	_

The	_
way	TARGET

While	TARGET
this	_
theory	_
is	_
exceedingly	_
simple	_
,	_
it	_
appears	TARGET
to	_
explain	TARGET
several	TARGET
things	_
.	_

First	TARGET
,	_
why	TARGET
ticket	_
splitting	TARGET
has	_
increased	TARGET
and	_
taken	_
the	_
peculiar	_
pattern	TARGET
that	_
it	_
has	_
over	_
the	_
past	TARGET
half	_
century	TARGET
:	_
Prior	TARGET
to	_
the	_
election	TARGET
of	_
Franklin	_
Roosevelt	_
as	_
president	TARGET
and	_
the	_
advent	_
of	_
the	_
New	_
Deal	_
,	_
government	TARGET
occupied	_
a	_
much	_
smaller	_
role	_
in	_
society	_
and	_
the	_
prisoner	_
's	_
dilemma	_
problem	TARGET
confronting	_
voters	_
in	_
races	_
for	_
Congress	_
was	_
considerably	_
less	_
severe	_
.	_

Second	TARGET
,	_
it	_
explains	TARGET
why	_
voters	_
hold	_
Congress	_
in	_
disdain	TARGET
but	TARGET
generally	_
love	TARGET
their	_
own	_
congressional	_
representatives	TARGET
:	_
Any	TARGET
individual	_
legislator	TARGET
's	_
constituents	_
appreciate	TARGET
the	_
specific	_
benefits	_
that	_
the	_
legislator	TARGET
wins	TARGET
for	_
them	_
but	_
not	_
the	_
overall	_
cost	TARGET
associated	TARGET
with	_
every	_
other	TARGET
legislator	_
doing	TARGET
likewise	_
for	_
his	_
own	_
constituency	_
.	_

Third	TARGET
,	_
the	_
theory	_
suggests	TARGET
why	_
legislators	TARGET
who	_
pay	_
too	_
much	_
attention	TARGET
to	_
national	TARGET
policy	TARGET
making	TARGET
relative	_
to	_
local	TARGET
benefit-seeking	_
have	TARGET
lower	TARGET
security	TARGET
in	_
office	_
.	_

For	_
example	_
,	_
first-term	_
members	TARGET
of	TARGET
the	_
House	_
,	_
once	_
the	_
most	_
vulnerable	TARGET
of	TARGET
incumbents	_
,	_
have	_
become	TARGET
virtually	_
immune	_
to	_
defeat	TARGET
.	_

The	_
one	TARGET
exception	_
to	_
this	_
recent	TARGET
trend	_
was	_
the	_
defeat	TARGET
of	_
13	_
of	TARGET
the	_
52	_
freshman	_
Republicans	_
brought	TARGET
into	TARGET
office	_
in	TARGET
1980	_
by	_
the	_
Reagan	_
revolution	TARGET
and	_
running	_
for	_
re-election	_
in	TARGET
1982	_
.	_

Because	TARGET
these	_
freshmen	_
placed	_
far	_
more	_
emphasis	TARGET
on	_
their	_
partisan	_
role	_
--	_
spreading	_
the	_
Reagan	_
revolution	_
--	_
in	_
national	TARGET
policy	TARGET
making	TARGET
,	_
they	_
were	_
more	_
vulnerable	TARGET
to	_
defeat	TARGET
.	_

Fourth	TARGET
,	_
the	_
theory	_
indicates	TARGET
why	_
the	_
Republican	_
Party	_
may	TARGET
have	_
a	_
difficult	TARGET
time	_
attracting	_
viable	_
candidates	_
for	_
congressional	_
office	_
.	_

Potential	TARGET
candidates	_
may	TARGET
be	_
discouraged	TARGET
from	_
running	_
less	_
by	_
the	_
congressional	_
salary	_
than	_
by	_
the	_
prospect	_
of	_
defeat	TARGET
at	_
the	_
hands	TARGET
of	_
a	_
Democratic	_
opponent	TARGET
.	_

To	_
the	_
extent	_
that	_
potential	TARGET
Republican	_
candidates	_
and	_
their	_
financial	_
backers	_
realize	TARGET
that	_
the	_
congressional	_
prisoner	_
's	_
dilemma	_
game	_
works	_
to	_
their	_
disadvantage	_
,	_
the	_
Republican	_
Party	_
will	_
be	_
hindered	TARGET
in	_
its	_
attempts	TARGET
to	_
field	_
a	_
competitive	_
slate	_
of	_
congressional	_
candidates	_
.	_

Fifth	TARGET
,	_
the	_
theory	_
may	TARGET
provide	TARGET
at	_
least	_
a	_
partial	_
reason	TARGET
for	_
why	_
ticket	_
splitting	TARGET
has	_
been	_
particularly	_
pronounced	_
in	TARGET
the	_
South	TARGET
.	_

To	_
the	_
extent	_
that	_
Democratic	_
legislators	TARGET
from	TARGET
the	_
South	_
have	_
held	_
a	_
disproportionate	_
share	_
of	TARGET
power	TARGET
in	_
Congress	_
since	TARGET
1932	_
and	_
have	_
been	_
able	TARGET
to	_
translate	_
such	_
clout	_
into	_
relatively	_
more	TARGET
local	TARGET
benefits	_
for	_
their	_
respective	_
constituencies	_
,	_
voters	_
in	TARGET
the	_
South	_
have	_
had	TARGET
an	_
especially	_
strong	TARGET
incentive	_
to	_
keep	TARGET
such	_
Democrats	_
in	_
office	_
.	_

Finally	_
,	_
the	_
theory	_
suggests	TARGET
why	_
Republicans	_
generally	_
have	_
fared	_
better	_
in	_
Senate	_
races	_
than	_
in	_
campaigns	_
for	_
the	_
House	_
.	_

Since	TARGET
local	TARGET
benefit-seeking	_
matters	_
more	_
and	_
national	TARGET
policy	TARGET
making	TARGET
matters	_
less	_
in	TARGET
the	_
lower	_
chamber	TARGET
of	_
Congress	_
,	_
this	_
is	_
precisely	_
the	_
pattern	TARGET
one	_
would	_
expect	TARGET
if	_
Republicans	_
are	_
less	_
willing	TARGET
to	_
engage	TARGET
in	_
local	TARGET
benefit-seeking	_
than	_
their	_
Democratic	_
counterparts	_
.	_

Is	TARGET
there	_
any	TARGET
empirical	_
support	_
for	_
this	_
theory	_
?	_

Three	TARGET
pieces	_
of	_
evidence	TARGET
corroborate	TARGET
the	_
key	TARGET
assumption	_
that	_
Democratic	_
legislators	TARGET
are	_
more	_
willing	TARGET
to	_
engage	TARGET
in	_
local	TARGET
benefit-seeking	_
than	_
their	_
Republican	_
colleagues	_
.	_

First	TARGET
,	_
economists	_
James	_
Bennett	_
and	_
Thomas	_
DiLorenzo	_
find	TARGET
that	_
GOP	_
senators	_
turn	_
back	_
roughly	_
10	TARGET
%	_
more	_
of	_
their	_
allocated	_
personal	_
staff	TARGET
budgets	_
than	_
Democrats	_
do	_
.	_

To	_
the	_
extent	_
that	_
the	_
primary	TARGET
duty	TARGET
of	_
personal	_
staff	TARGET
involves	_
local	TARGET
benefit-seeking	_
,	_
this	_
indicates	TARGET
that	_
political	_
philosophy	_
leads	TARGET
congressional	_
Republicans	_
to	_
pay	_
less	_
attention	TARGET
to	_
narrow	_
constituent	_
concerns	_
.	_

Second	TARGET
,	_
if	_
the	_
key	TARGET
assumption	_
is	_
valid	TARGET
,	_
Democrats	_
should	_
have	TARGET
lower	TARGET
attendance	TARGET
rates	_
on	_
roll-call	_
votes	_
than	_
Republicans	_
do	_
to	_
the	_
extent	_
that	_
such	_
votes	_
reflect	_
national	TARGET
policy	TARGET
making	TARGET
and	_
that	_
participating	TARGET
in	_
such	_
votes	_
takes	TARGET
away	_
from	_
the	_
time	TARGET
a	_
legislator	TARGET
could	TARGET
otherwise	_
devote	_
to	TARGET
local	TARGET
benefit-seeking	_
.	_

This	_
is	_
indeed	_
what	_
the	_
data	TARGET
indicate	TARGET
,	_
particularly	_
in	_
the	_
case	TARGET
of	_
the	_
House	_
.	_

The	_
Democratic	_
House	_
attendance	TARGET
rate	_
has	_
not	_
exceeded	_
the	_
Republican	_
House	_
attendance	TARGET
rate	_
since	TARGET
1959	_
.	_

Finally	_
,	_
as	_
shown	TARGET
in	TARGET
the	_
table	_
,	_
Democrats	_
allocate	_
a	_
higher	TARGET
proportion	_
of	TARGET
their	_
personal	_
staffs	TARGET
to	TARGET
district	_
offices	_
--	_
where	TARGET
local	TARGET
benefit-seeking	_
duties	TARGET
matter	_
more	_
and	_
national	TARGET
policy	TARGET
making	TARGET
activities	TARGET
matter	_
